# Tables adapted from the Xotl FACTION ASSIGNMENT & RARITY TABLES           #
#   Original tables can be found here:                                      #

#   As noted in the original files, these are fan works and should not be   #
#   taken as official in any way.                                           #

# Notes on adaptation:                                                      #
# * The original Xotl tables use a d1,000 to randomly determine the unit.   #
#   For the adaptation I simply use the frequency of the entry as the       #
#   MegaMek RAT Weight value.  So, a unit that appears on rolls 101-200     #
#   receives a base Weight of 100.                                          #
