<overview>
Developed when Clan Jade Falcon warriors demanded their own super-heavy OmniFighter to compete against Clan Ghost Bear's Kirghiz, the Scytha favors speed and pod space over that venerable fighter's preference for armor.
</overview>

<deployment>
A ranged combat variant, the Scytha C mounts a Gauss Rifle and ER PPC underslung on each wing, support by twin nose-mounted Medium Pulse Lasers. A single ER small laser defends the aft of the craft, while two tons of Gauss Rifle reloads allows the C variant to keep its heat in check at least in the early stages of an engagement.
