<notes>
From the TRO: The TR-11 is a factory-built reconnaissance
variant that removes the four lasers; instead, the cockpit is widened to make room for an observer and a large variety of scanning and sensor equipment. This equipment has never been defined.

<capabilities>
Built as a 'Mech-buster and DropShip attack craft, the Transit isn't fast or agile, but is easy to control and has had few loss of control accidents.
</capabilities>

<overview>
A common sight in House Liao and Capellan Confederation air lances, the Transit has armor and weapons to spare.
</overview>

<deployment>
Recon version, eliminating the four Medium Lasers to save weight for an enlarged cockpit and extra sensors. This version also has a second seat for an observer.
