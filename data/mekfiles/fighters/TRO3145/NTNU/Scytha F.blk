<overview>
Developed when Clan Jade Falcon warriors demanded their own super-heavy OmniFighter to compete against Clan Ghost Bear's Kirghiz, the Scytha favors speed and pod space over that venerable fighter's preference for armor.
</overview>

<deployment>
This Dark Age configuration carries two Improved Heavy Large Lasers in the nose, supported by an Ultra AC/20 and Streak SRM-6. The lasers and autocannon are tied into a Targeting Computer and a Watchdog CEWS disrupts enemy communications and targeting systems.
