<capabilities>
Built as a 'Mech-buster and DropShip attack craft, the Transit isn't fast or agile, but is easy to control and has had few loss of control accidents.
</capabilities>

<overview>
A common sight in House Liao and Capellan Confederation air lances, the Transit has armor and weapons to spare.
</overview>

<deployment>
Based on the Transit Glare, this version offers identical performance and protection to the pilot. The only real change was in the main armament. Unable to secure a steady supply of Improved Heavy Gauss Rifles, the TR-13G instead uses a Long Tom Cannon with three tons of ammunition as its main armament. This massive weapon provided a longer reach and massive firepower against incoming DropShips while not affecting the Transit's traditional ground attack role. The variant uses an Endicott Type 28 Maser communications system.
