overview:The Bane is a BattleMech that is based upon a Star League prototype that was never put into production. Tagged the Kraken by Inner Sphere forces who opposed it.

capabilities:The Bane was first built in 2827. It was originally a significant part of many Clan toumans, but was gradually relegated to second-line status following the introduction of the OmniMech. As such, it is still critical to many defensive units. The design uses a lightweight XL Engine so that it can mount the arsenal that it does. Nineteen tons of armor protects this venerable assault 'Mech.

deployment:This design changes the weapons configuration totally. Eight LRM-15 provide fire support, while sixteen tons of ammunition proves sufficient for the design. A One-Shot Streak SRM-4 provides one-time close support. Nineteen double heat sinks are up to the task of keeping the design cool.
