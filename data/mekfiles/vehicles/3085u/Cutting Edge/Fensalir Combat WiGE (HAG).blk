<capabilities>
The Fensalir at the time was the largest Combat WiGE of its kind. It boasted 11.5 tons of Heavy Ferro-Fibrous armor to protect its hull. The vehicle features an Infantry Transport Bay to allow it to deliver up to 4 tons of troops to a hot zone.
</capabilities>

<overview>
The Fensalir Combat WiGE was an attack craft which was built as a joint effort between Johnston Industries and House Steiner based manufacturer Nashan Diversified.
</overview>

<deployment>
Originally known as the A88 by Inner Sphere intelligence organizations developed in 3084, this vehicle turns out to be Clan Wolf-in-Exile's copy of the Fensalir. This Fensalir is a Mix-Tech variant which uses both Inner Sphere chassis components and Clan weaponry. The main weapon is swapped out for a Class 30 Hyper-Assault Gauss Rifle. The secondary weaponry is changed out for a pair of ATM 9 launchers and the Clan version of the ER Medium Lasers. The vehicle's infantry bay is reconfigured to handle a point's worth of Battle Armor
</deployment>

<history>
The Fensalir was first produced at Nashan's plant on Furillo in 3084, while Johnston - still rebuilding its own manufacturing facilities - shipped components to assemble the WiGEs. When it was first produced, the vehicle initially entered service with the newly-renamed Lyran Commonwealth Armed Forces and later being copied by Clan Wolf-in-Exile for their own use.
