<capabilities>
The Duplus Contubernium is a two-squad deployment of Marian Hegemony infantry.  Multiple contubernium working together constitute an infantry Century in the MHAF, typically numbering 50 total soldiers for jump infantry.
</capabilities>

<notes>
Marian Hegemony jump infantry platoons consist of a 50-trooper Century comprised of five 10-trooper contubernia or squads. Game play requires this to be broken down into units of 30 or fewer troopers, with the Duplus Contubernium being a two-squad (20 trooper) deployment and the Triplus Contubernium being a three-squad (30 trooper) deployment.
