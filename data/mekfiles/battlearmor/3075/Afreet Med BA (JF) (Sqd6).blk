<overview>
The Afreet is a battle armor design created by Clan Ice Hellion. The Afreet was created when Khan Raina Montose ordered two other projects merged, resulting in a battlesuit that seems to fit in well with the Hellion belief in speed over all else.
</overview>

<history>
Following the Hellion invasion of the Inner Sphere, both Clan Jade Falcon and Clan Hell's Horses salvaged and produced their own versions.
</history>

<capabilities>
The primary feature of the Afreet is its ability to leap one hundred twenty meters at a time. This comes at a sacrifice to armor, as the Afreet is only able to stop a Clan ER Small Laser. It does, however, use Improved Sensors, a holdover from one of the suits it descended from.
</capabilities>

<deployment>
The variant was produced by Clan Jade Falcon starting in 3072 and replaced the rifle and sensors with an AP Gauss Rifle and Fire Resistant Armor.
