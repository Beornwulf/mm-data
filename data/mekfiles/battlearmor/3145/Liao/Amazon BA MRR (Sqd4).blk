<overview>
The Amazon battle armor was created by the Magistracy of Canopus.
</overview>

<history>
The Amazon is used by both the Magistracy and the Capellan Confederation. Amazons deployed by the Capellan Confederation Armed Forces faced Cavalier battle armor and turned in a better performance.
</history>

<capabilities>
Based on the standard Inner Sphere battle armor, the Amazon uses advanced armor to increase protection and provides a jump capability of 90 meters. This allows Amazon-equipped troops to clear obstacles that would stop other battle armor units.
</capabilities>

<deployment>
The Amazon has a Modular Weapon Mount on the right arm which can be configured to support either a Medium Recoilless Rifle or a Support PPC. The left arm carries a Battle Claw which allows Amazon pilots to make anti-'Mech attacks or ride an Omnimech into battle.
