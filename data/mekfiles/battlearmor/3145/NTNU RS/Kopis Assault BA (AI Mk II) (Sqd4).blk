<overview>
The Kopis battle armor was designed by StarCorps Industries as an assault unit.
</overview>

<capabilities>
Slow but heavily armed, the Kopis can remain on the battlefield supporting friendly units for a long time. The advanced armor used by the Kopis designers allows it to stand up to most weaponry, shrugging off anything short of a PPC or AC/10 hit. The low top speed is mitigated through the use of VTOL transportation for offensive operations, while smart commanders use the Kopis as a defense unit for cities or other tight terrain. In those restricted environments the low top speed isn't a factor.
</capabilities>

<deployment>
This variant replaced the Anti-Infantry model in 3090, equipped with two Heavy Battle Claws, two Heavy Grenade Launchers, and two Heavy Recoilless Rifles. It also carries Improved Sensors.
</deployment>

<history>
 The standard model was given the nickname of "The Dark Alley".
