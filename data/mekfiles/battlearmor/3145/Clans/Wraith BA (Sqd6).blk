<overview>
The Wraith battle armor was designed by the Rasalhague Dominion to support conventional infantry as well as perform surgical strikes.
</overview>

<capabilities>
It is equipped with Basic Stealth armor to hide it from enemy probes, and its jump jets allow it to cover ninety meters in a single jump. The suit was introduced after extensive testing of the Rogue Bear battle armor, and is a direct descendant of that design.
</capabilities>

<deployment>
The typical Wraith suit is equipped with a single Machine Gun in each arm. These are supplemented by a Vibro-Claw on each arm for close quarter combat and anti-'Mech attacks. These are also useful during boarding actions.
