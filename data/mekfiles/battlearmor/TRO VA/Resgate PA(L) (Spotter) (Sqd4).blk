<overview>
The Resgate power armor is the result of a devastating earthquake on the Clan world of Homer.
</overview>

<capabilities>
The Resgate is fitted with Jump Jets, a Salvage Arm, and fire resistant armor. It also is fitted with Improved Sensors. The light exoskeleton was later fitted with Fire Resistant armor which was won by the Clan's scientist caste against Clan Fire Mandrill.
</capabilities>

<deployment>
Developed in the Jihad, this variant removes the standard equipment and carries a Light TAG and Armored Gloves.
</deployment>

<history>
 Clan Cloud Cobra's Warrior Council, after seeing so many of the lower castes killed, pushed the effort for this new design. It specialized exclusively in improving rescue operations in emergency situations. However, the design was stripped to the bare minimum of technology needed for the job. There were no combat applications fitted to the suit. After equipping the suits with fire resistant armor, members of the 849th Fire Response Unit were able to save nearly every member of a crashed DropShip from an inferno. Only one member of the crew perished.
