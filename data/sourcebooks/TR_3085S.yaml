description: '<p><strong>Technical Addendum</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even the most
  thorough field reports can miss a detail or two. During the eventful times surrounding
  the end of the Word of Blake Jihad and the rise of the Republic of the Sphere, military
  factories across the Inner Sphere scrambled to rearm the various realms mauled by
  a decade of bloody conflict. In the shuffle, a few new developments emerged, overlooked
  in the grand scheme--but not for long.</p><p><strong>Technical Readout: 3085 Supplemental</strong>

  vehicles, ''Mechs, and aerospace units that debuted during the Jihad and its immediate
  aftermath.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-technical-readout-3085-supplemental-pdf">Buy
