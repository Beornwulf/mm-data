description: '<p>In the 3050s, the discoveries of long-buried Star League records
  led to a plethora of new cutting-edge BattleMech and combat vehicles designs by
  the end of that decade, resurrected from the blueprints of design firms centuries
  old. At the same time, the Clans introduction of battle armor spurned the Inner
  Sphere to introduce a plethora of powered infantry designs. Now, ten years later,
  these designs have moved from novelty to workhorse, giving rise to notable MechWarriors,
  crews and troopers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BattleTech Record Sheets: 3058 Upgrade,
  Clan Mechs, Star League Units and Battle Armor</strong> offers players the record
  sheets for all the Clan Mechs, Star League units and battle armor detailed in <i>BattleTech
