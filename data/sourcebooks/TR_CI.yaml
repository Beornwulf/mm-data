description: '<p><strong>INVADERS FROM BEYOND</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On 27 September
  3048, the ComStar Explorer Corps JumpShip Outbound Light stumbled onto the Clan
  Homeworlds, setting in motion a massive invasion of the Inner Sphere by the Clans.
  At first sweeping all before them with their advanced technologies, the Clans met
  defeat at the Battle of Tukayyid and were stymied by a 15-year truce. With the clock
  ticking, the Inner Sphere’s elite took the battle directly to the Clan Homeworlds.
  There, the destruction of Clan Smoke Jaguar and the defeat of the Clans in the Great
  Refusal ended the invasion.</p><p>In their absence, political machinations continued
  across the Inner Sphere. As the victorious forces returned home, the mighty Federated
  Commonwealth tore itself apart in a titanic Civil War spanning a thousand light
  years as Houses Davion and Steiner pitted brother against sister. These large-scale
  conflicts accelerated technical advancements, as a new generation of BattleMechs
  and weapons appeared on a hundred worlds of conflict.</p><p><strong>Technical Readout:
