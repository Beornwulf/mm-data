  Descendants of the Star League Defense Force, they returned to the Inner Sphere
  in 3050 with violence and honor. Stalled by the combined might of the Inner Sphere,
  the Clans have been waiting for the chance to strike for Terra once more. But fractures
  within Nicholas Kerensky''s Great Society have widened. A new enemy threatens to
  destroy the Clans once and for all: themselves. The resulting Wars of Reaving touches
  every Clan: some will be destroyed, all will be forever altered.<p>_x000D_
