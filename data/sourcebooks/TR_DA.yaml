description: '<h2>DARKEST BEFORE THE DAWN</h2><p>From the star-spanning devastation
  of the Word of Blake Jihad arose the Republic of the Sphere, a new nation dedicated
  to breaking the centuries-long cycle of warfare plaguing the Inner Sphere and creating
  new innovation and prosperity for all.</p><p>The ideals of the Republic worked—for
  a time.</p><p>Then in 3132, hyperpulse generators across thousands of worlds went
  offline, enveloping the Inner Sphere in silence. Paranoia and opportunism ran rampant
  as age-old hostilities reignited and chaos ruled the day. The Republic, the grand
  experiment in hope, was torn asunder by hostile forces on every side.</p><p>The
  Republic Era—better known as the Dark Age—was a time of upheaval and opportunity.
  Fortunes rose and fell, nations crumbled and others reconstituted. And at the center
  of the whirlwind lay Terra, the crown jewel of the Republic, a prize waiting for
  the warrior strong enough to seize it.</p><p><i>Technical Readout: Dark Age</i>
