  Running a merc unit is a serious business first, last and always. Not just any group
  of gung-ho ''Mech jocks can survive in the cutthroat world of the mercenary, and
  any MechWarrior who ignores this fact ends up working for someone else, dispossessed,
  or dead. Running a successful merc unit takes know-how, skill, careful planning,
  and sometimes a little luck. If you still think you''ve got what it takes to pit
  your skills against the fiercest warriors of the Inner Sphere and beyond, The Mercenary''s
  Handbook: 3055 is for you. The handbook provides a comprehensive, detailed system
  for creating, maintaining, and operating a mercenary unit in the BattleTech universe,
  covering every aspect of the mercenary life from combat to salary to medical care.<p>_x000D_

  The Mercenary''s Handbook: 3055 also includes detailed briefings on five of the
  most renowned mercenary units of the Inner Sphere: Wolf''s Dragoons, the Kell Hounds,
  Rhonda Snord''s Irregulars, the Gray Death Legion, and the Black Thorns. So what
  are you waiting for? C-bills and glory await any MechWarrior bold enough to take
  them. But just remember, the battle''s not over until the check clears..._x000D_
