description: '<b>To Honor the Dragon</b>_x000D_

  _x000D_

  <p>Some soldiers fight for money, some to spread their version of liberty, still
  others for a sense of adventure. For the men and women of the Draconis Combine Mustered
  Soldiery there is only one reason for service: the honor of the Dragon._x000D_

  From the moment Shiro Kurita raised the Dragon''s banner, the soldiers of House
  Kurita have remained dedicated to the warrior''s path above all others. For seven
  centuries they have spread fear and respect in equal measure, expanding and protecting
  the Dragon with loyalty and honor tempered by the ancient code of bushido and forged
  in battles on a hundred worlds._x000D_

  _x000D_

  <p><i>BattleTech Combat Manual: Kurita</i> contains information on these warriors.
  This manual examines the combat commands of the Draconis Combine, detailing their
  histories, tactics, unit crests, paint schemes, and notable personnel. This <b>Alpha
  Strike</b> expansion includes special rules for unique character abilities, faction-specific
  rules, force-building, and a mini-Technical Readout--everything you need to field
  your favorite Draconis Combine unit on the tabletop, or create your own._x000D_
