  As one of the most powerful interstellar corporations in the Inner Sphere--with
  satellite plants in every House--such questions are imperative for StarCorps Industries.
  In the tumultuous time of the Jihad, as power brokers fall and new personalities
  rise to prominence, the answers to such questions can mean the difference between
  a fat in-the-black account and operations in the red. And no corporation, much less
  one as powerful and far reaching as StarCorps Industries, treats failure well.<p>_x000D_

  Masters and Minions: The StarCorps Dossiers is a sourcebook from the perspective
  of StarCorps Industries, compiled from dozens of sources by an army of administrators,
  all with an eye towards furthering StarCorps markets and interest. Masters and Minions
  is a complete who''s-who of the BattleTech universe, with well over a hundred personalities
  detailed. Short overviews of all the major and most minor factions of the Inner
  Sphere are also included, briefly covering such details as their most notable factories,
  planets and military forces._x000D_
