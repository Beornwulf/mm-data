description: '<p>The march of technology across BattleTech’s eras is relentless—but
  some BattleMech designs never die. Each installment of this PDF-only series not
  only includes a brand new BattleMech or OmniMech, but also details Classic ’Mech
  designs from both the Inner Sphere and the Clans, now fully rebuilt with Dark Age
  technology (3085 and beyond). Allowing beloved units redesigned for the BattleTech:
  Clan Invasion crowd funding campaign to be competitive on “modern” battlefields,
  this series also includes in-universe development notes, battle histories, notable
  pilots, and record sheets for each ’Mech. Released as a series of 22 PDF-only documents
  through the end of 2020 and early 2021, many ’Mechs featured in this series will
  be collected as a single print volume upon its completion._x000D_
