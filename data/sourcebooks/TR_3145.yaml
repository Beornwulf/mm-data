description: '<p><strong>Eve of Destruction</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The great
  experiment that was the Republic of the Sphere has failed. Withdrawn behind the
  Fortress walls, the once-great power has become a silent, opaque remnant of its
  former glory. Without its influence, old hatreds have risen anew. As war once more
  rages across the Inner Sphere, new equipment strides across ancient battlefields.
  Technology, once stagnated by trade restrictions and peace treaties, now surges
  forward again, testing these new machines in the fierce crucible of war.</p><p><strong>Technical
  Readout: 3145</strong> introduces the latest wave of new battle armor, vehicle,
  ''Mech, and aerospace units appearing in the Republic Armed Forces and across the
  Inner Sphere in the Dark Age era. Featuring new equipment described in <i>Era Report:
  3145</i> and <i>Field Manual: 3145</i>, this book brings players an update on the
  advancing technologies used in the battlefields of the thirty-second century.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br><a
