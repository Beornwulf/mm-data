description: '<p><strong>Desperate Measures, Cut-Rate Prices</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The
  fires of the Jihad have crippled the collective military-industrial complexes of
  the Inner Sphere, sparking a desperate call for equipment--any equipment--to replace
  combat losses. While the factories of the Successor States and the Periphery struggle
  to recover, a wave of second-grade manufacturers, relying on older, outdated methods,
  have rushed to take up some of the slack by bringing back venerable designs not
  seen since before the first Star League. Still others have taken to offering armed
  support units to fill in the gaps, ''Mechs and vehicles that, while not up to the
  late thirty-first century cutting edge, can still bring lethal force to bear in
  a pinch.</p><p><strong>Experimental Technical Readout: RetroTech</strong> samples
  a number of new designs that have begun to emerge from secondary manufacturers across
  the war-torn Inner Sphere. Representing modern manufacturing with older techniques,
  most of the designs featured in this book incorporate a mix of modern technologies
  and older design standards--many rushed into service for their desperate consumers.
  Statistics and Record Sheets are included for 13 new experimental BattleMechs, vehicles,
  and aerospace units presented in this book, ready for play in advanced <i>BattleTech</i>
  games.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-experimental-technical-readout-retrotech-pdf">Buy
