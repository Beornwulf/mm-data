  <p>A young Periphery volunteer struggles against marauding pirates who have long
  overstayed their welcome. A small-but-growing mercenary unit faces off against a
  formidable foe capable of destroying their dreams. A Star League MechWarrior wrestles
  with an exciting career opportunity on the eve of the war that will change the face
  of the Inner Sphere forever. Experience the costly Jade Falcon assault on Arc-Royal,
  return to an idyllic paradise haunted by a specter of the past, and follow a Clan
  Wolf bondsman’s quest to reunite with his son. Then lurk in the shadows with more
  cloak-and-dagger plots in the continuation of the four-part serial novel set on
  the game world of Solaris VII._x000D_
