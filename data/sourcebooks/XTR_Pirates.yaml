description: '<p><strong>The Engineers'' Playground</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thieves,
  rogues, outlaws, murderers, scum-these are the pirates of the Inner Sphere. For
  mankind''s worst element, the chaos of the Jihad is simply another opportunity to
  profit through force. The tools of the militaries they face are tough, but it doesn''t
  take an unlimited budget and the resources of a stellar empire to get creative-and
  stolen prototype weapons can kill just as well as anything off the shelf. Armed
  with the best tech they can lay their hands on, the cleverest pirates field experimental-grade
  BattleMechs, vehicles, and fighters that keep their enemies guessing!</p><p><strong>Experimental
  Tech Readout: Pirates</strong> samples the custom designs that have appeared in
  the BattleTech universe during the Jihad. Each design featured in this book incorporates
  some of the latest technologies developed by the realms of the Inner Sphere in their
  war against the Word of Blake, as first described in <i>Tactical Operations</i>-deployed
  now by the malcontents daring enough to steal them. Statistics and Record Sheets
  are included for 13 new experimental BattleMechs, vehicles, and aerospace units,
  ready for play in advanced <i>BattleTech</i> games.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-experimental-technical-readout-pirates-pdf">Buy
