description: '<p><strong>Kuritan Finesse</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Battered by the
  Jihad, but never broken, House Kurita''s Draconis Combine is crawling from the ashes
  of devastation. The Black Pearl lies in ruins, taking with it many of the Draconis
  Combine''s greatest innovations. But as the Dragon fights on, research and development
  teams across the realm have scrambled to recover the technological edge that helped
  House Kurita keep the Clans at bay for so long. In factories and test sites deep
  within their borders, they have developed powerful new secret weapons in the war
  against the Word of Blake--or anyone else who would bring the Combine low.</p><p><strong>Experimental
  Technical Readout: Kurita</strong> samples the custom and prototype designs that
  have begun to turn up in testing labs and top-secret proving grounds of the Draconis
  Combine. Each design featured in this book incorporates some of the latest technologies
  developed by the realms of the Inner Sphere as the war against the Word of Blake
  continues. These technologies--first described in <i>Tactical Operations</i>--have
  yet to achieve widespread production, but each has been prototyped and rushed to
  the field for their desperate consumers. Statistics and Record Sheets are included
  for 13 new experimental BattleMechs, vehicles, aerospace units, and battle armor
  designs presented in this book, ready for play in advanced <i>BattleTech</i> games.</p><p><br><a
