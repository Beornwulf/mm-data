  _x000D_

  Theodore Kurita, samurai tyrant of the mighty Draconis Combine, is celebrating his
  sixty-first birthday. Topping the guest list is an unlikely bunch of high-tech troublemakers:
  Camacho''s Caballeros, the toughest team of mercenary MechWarriors the Inner Sphere
  has ever seen. But their invitation is more than merely social. Theodore''s powerful
  cousin, "Uncle Chandy," has recruited their ace operative, Cassie Suthorn, for a
  dangerous mission.<p>_x000D_

  On an xenophobic planet where honor and duty are worshipped like deities, the freelancing
  Caballeros are considered barbarians. But Cassie''s covert investigation uncovers
  an insurrection, and Camacho''s foreign "barbarians" could be the only unit with
  enough guns and grit to save the Draconis Combine from its own extremists. And when
  the armor-piercing rockets and laser fire finally subside, counted among the slain
  may be Cassie and many of her courageous comrades -- as well as the fragile peace
  of the entire Inner Sphere..._x000D_
