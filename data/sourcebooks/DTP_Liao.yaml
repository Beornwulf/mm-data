  _x000D_

  When The Republic of the Sphere was founded by Devlin Stone after the Word of Blake
  Jihad, Sun-Tzu Liao was forced to give up many of his worlds to the new nation.
  Several times in the following decades the Capellan Confederation tried and failed
  to reclaim those worlds, including the ancestral homeworld of Liao.<p>_x000D_

  But Sun-Tzu’s son, Daoshen, is crafty and patient.<p>_x000D_

  _x000D_

  In the wake of the devastating collapse of the hyperpulse generator network, The
  Republic is beset on all sides and Daoshen sees his chance. Taking advantage of
  a student uprising and unrest against The Republic, Daoshen’s secret agitators and
  devoted troops will try one more time to avenge the dishonor of losing Liao. And
  this time, they will know victory!<p>_x000D_

  This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option
  of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into their
  own campaigns and even create their own scenarios with optional rules to give their
  games a “Liao flavor.” The ebook includes a detailed map of the world of Liao, a
  run down of the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks that players
  can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage up to a world-wide invasion.
  Only the players’ imaginations are the limits._x000D_
