description: 'For the planet Vega, the collapse of the hyperpulse generator network
  signaled the beginning of four years of chaos. Beset by terrorists, foreign invaders
  and the shattering of the planetary militia in a devastating civil war, the world
  descended into a seemingly endless spiral of death and destruction. Ruthless warlords
  divided the land and fought amongst themselves to claim what little remained of
  the old Vega. With the Republic suffering its own troubles, there was scant hope
  of relief from any outside force._x000D_

  And then the Bears came._x000D_

  Enacting contingency plans created decades earlier, the Rasalhague Dominion sends
  its forces to stabilize several worlds of the Republic. But their reception is anything
  but warm and the Clanners will have to face local resistance and malicious outside
  influences to save Vega from itself. Isis Bekker and her Raging Bears are up for
  the task, but will they have the strength and the time to see it through?_x000D_

  <b>Dark Age Turning Points: Vega</b> uses <i>Chaos Campaign</i> rules and gives
  players the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting
  it into their own campaigns and even creating their own scenarios with optional
  rules to give their games a “Vega flavor.” The ebook includes a detailed map of
  the world of Vega, a run down of the forces involved in the conflict, and several
  tracks that players can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage up to
  a world-wide invasion. Only the players’ imaginations are the limits._x000D_
