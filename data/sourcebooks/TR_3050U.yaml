description: '<p><strong>Technological Renaissance</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Over
  two hundred and fifty years ago, General Aleksandr Kerensky departed human-occupied
  space, taking three-quarters of the Star League Defense Force with him. They returned
  in 3050 as the Clans: a society dedicated to the highest warrior ideals and bent
  on conquering the Inner Sphere. With their OmniMechs and superior technology, they
  proved almost unstoppable until their defeat at Tukayyid and subsequent 15 year
  truce. The year is now 3071, and the Jihad rages. Inner Sphere ''Mechs, hastily
  upgraded with field modifications to counter the Clans, continue to prove their
  worth. Notable pilots rise to become heroes as new, time tested variants--sporting
  weapons right out of R&amp;D labs--make their presence known. And over it all, Clan
  OmniMechs continue to prove they are still the cutting edge of technology.</p><p><strong>Classic
  BattleTech Technical Readout: 3050 Upgrade</strong> fully updates this venerable
  product, fleshing out the history of each design, including notable MechWarriors/pilots,
  as well as providing fresh illustrations. Additionally, all the ''Mechs, vehicles,
  and aerospace fighters originally found in the out-of-print <i>Technical Readout:
  2750</i> are included.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-technical-readout-3050-upgrade-pdf">Buy
