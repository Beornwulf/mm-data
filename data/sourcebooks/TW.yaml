description: '<b>THE FUTURE OF WARFARE!</b><p><p>_x000D_

  _x000D_

  It is the 31st century, a time of endless wars that rage across human-occupied space.
  As star empires clash, these epic wars are won and lost by BattleMechs, 30-foot-tall
  humanoid metal titans bristling with lasers, autocannons and dozens of other lethal
  weapons; enough firepower to level entire city blocks. Your elite force of MechWarriors
  drives these juggernauts into battle, proudly holding your faction''s flag high,
  intent on expanding the power and glory of your realm. At their beck and call are
  the support units of armored vehicles, power armored infantry, aerospace fighters
  and more, wielded by a MechWarrior''s skillful command to aid him in ultimate victory.
  Will they become legends, or forgotten casualties? Only your skill and luck will
  determine their fate!<p>_x000D_

  work for people who know the game, while introducing more technologies and expansive
  rules than appear in the basic box set. The introductory game in the BattleTech
  line is the <a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-a-game-of-armored-combat">BattleTech
