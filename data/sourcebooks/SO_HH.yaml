description: 'Born in the fires of Operation: GUERRERO, Holt’s Hilltoppers took on
  missions from the Periphery to the Chaos March, displaying grit and tenacity to
  rival any famed mercenary command. Action against Periphery pirates earned the Hilltoppers
  a reputation as savage defenders, but disaster during the St. Ives War nearly ended
  the command’s existence. Steadfast courage and resilience kept them together, aided
  by an alliance with Periphery renegades. Glory and infamy awaited in the FedCom
  Civil War, along with respect and eternal enmity in equal measure. Tiring of the
  vagabond life, the Hilltoppers found a new home outside the boundaries of the Inner
  Sphere. The Fronc Reaches offer constancy, but safety is always in short supply.
