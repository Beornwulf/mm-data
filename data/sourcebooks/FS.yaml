  <b>First Strike!</b> is a unique <i>BattleTech</i> game supplement created especially
  for players new to the game. It features thirteen ready-to-play scenarios that require
  only the contents of the boxed game to play: 9 scenarios for BattleTech, Fourth
  Edition, including a 3-part mini-campaign; 3 scenarios for CityTech, Second Edition,
  featuring battles from the Clan invasion; and one huge scenario that combines them
  both in a titanic struggle for survival!<p>_x000D_

  New players and old hands alike can also create an endless variety of original scenarios
  with the new scenario-creation systems. Extensive sections on tactics offer players
  of all skill levels new insights into BattleTech and CityTech gaming strategies.
  First Strike! also includes new armored vehicles and OmniMech configurations for
  use with CityTech._x000D_
