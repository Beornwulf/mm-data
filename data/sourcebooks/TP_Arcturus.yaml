  _x000D_

  As the Jihad unfolded, Chandrasekhar Kurita fought a one-man war against the Blakists
  when others would not. From the cradle of the Lyran Commonwealth, Kurita built a
  coalition of mercenaries to expose one of the Word''s darkest--and turn the Inner
  Sphere against their real enemy.<p>_x000D_

  _x000D_

  But the Word of Blake had other plans. To protect their secrets, they launched an
  invasion of Arcturus to punish Kurita and his mercenary cohorts. Led by a vicious
  Shadow Division and one of their best operatives, the battle for Arcturus became
  more than just survival as the very fate of the Inner Sphere hung in the balance.<p>_x000D_

  This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option
  of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, or inserting it into their
  own campaigns. This PDF exclusive includes a rundown of the forces involved in the
  conflict and several tracks that players can use to recreate the entire violent
  conflict on Arcturus. The only limits are the players'' imaginations._x000D_
