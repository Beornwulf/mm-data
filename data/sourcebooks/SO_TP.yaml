description: 'Beyond the edge of acknowledged civilization lie the Outworlds Wastes.
  Planets abandoned by the Star League centuries ago. Governments shattered by apathy,
  obscurity, and the march of time struggle to provide even the most basic needs of
  their people. From these meager surroundings one small but zealously dedicated unit
  stands to serve and protect the remnants of their realm. The Thermo Police may be
  enrolled as mercenaries but in truth they patrol these lawless stars seeking to
  bring the order they once knew. Specializing in non-lethal tactics, and trained
  beyond the typical pirates and bandits prowling the Wastes, their next encounter
  could be from past the distant stars they call home. But will it be a threat or
  an opportunity?<p><p>_x000D_
