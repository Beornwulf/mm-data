description: '<p>On the pirate haven of Tortuga Prime, alliances can shift and power
  can exchange hands at a moment’s notice. An interstellar kleptocracy, Tortuga Prime’s
  only rule is simple: take what you need, and try to keep it. Will you further the
  centuries-old cycle of needless death and destruction—or put a stop to it once and
  for all?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Touring the Stars is a whistle-stop tour of the universe!
  Every system and planet where mankind treads in the BattleTech universe has a story,
  for those with the drive to explore it. Take a tour of the stars humanity now calls
  home, experience awesome new worlds, immerse yourself in the local civilization,
  and prepare to do battle in exotic locales.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-touring-the-stars-tortuga-prime">Buy
