description: '<p>The year is 3146. The Inner Sphere is embroiled in some of the most
  devastating warfare since the Word of Blake Jihad. Within its Fortress walls, the
  core of the Republic lies safe for now, yet poised in a state of uneasy readiness.
  Desperate to maintain its battlefield edge, new technologies--including volatile,
  experimental gear from the Republic''s Institute for Strategic Combat, and its equally
  revolutionary Rhodes Project--have been hastily pressed into service. But the Republic''s
  enemies have not been idle, and the reports of new Clan innovations have come as
  a rude surprise. The future of the Inner Sphere now hangs in a precarious balance;
  who will have the weapons to turn conflict''s tide to their own favor?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Experimental
  Technical Readout: Republic III</strong> samples production and custom machines
  that have appeared in the BattleTech universe by the early decades of the thirty-second
  century. Each unit featured in this book incorporates some of the new technologies
  that debuted in both Tactical Operations and Interstellar Operations--now employed
  by the armed forces of the Republic of the Sphere and its contemporaries. Statistics
  and Record Sheets are included for 13 new advanced and experimental BattleMechs,
  vehicles, and aerospace and battle armor units ready for play in <i>BattleTech</i>
  games up to the year 3146.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-experimental-technical-readout-republic-iii-pdf">Buy
