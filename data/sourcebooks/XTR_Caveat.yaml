description: '<p>After Gray Monday, the Republic has descended into a new Dark Age,
  ploughshares are being turned back into swords, and the jackals are feeding on the
  confusion. The desperate need for weapons of new militaries arising everywhere sees
  mundane machines strapped with outlandish weapons, flamboyant arena ’Mechs returning
  to the battlefield, and renowned manufacturers engaging in uncharacteristic experimental
  gambles. It is a seller’s market; anything goes and no price is too high. Caveat
  emptor—the dust will settle quicker on your new acquisition’s battlefield debut
  than on the transaction that got you there. You won’t have time for buyer’s remorse.</p><p><strong>Experimental
  Technical Readout: Caveat Emptor</strong> samples production and prototype machines
  that have earnt infamy after Gray Monday as inefficient monstrosities sold to the
  highest bidder. Each unit featured in this book incorporates some of the new technologies
  that debuted in Tactical Operations (or quirks found in the <i>BattleMech Manual</i>)—now
  employed on battlefields of brush wars on former Republic worlds. Statistics and
  Record Sheets are included for 13 new advanced and experimental BattleMechs, ready
  for play in advanced <i>BattleTech</i> games.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/collections/battletech-new-arrivals/products/battletech-experimental-technical-readout-caveat-emptor?variant=39295245189154">Get
