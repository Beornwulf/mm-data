description: '<p><strong>Unsung Workhorses</strong></p><p>MechWarriors receive all
  the glory; aerospace fighters are a close second; vehicles are considered the workhorses
  of any military; infantry are even given their day in the sun in the minds of the
  common citizen. But no battle could be waged, nor won, without the mammoth apparatus
  of support vehicles that feed the war machine of the Great Houses. From cargo trucks
  to tanker airships, airborne MASH to communications satellites, armored transport
  rails to coastal patrol boats, hauler exoskeletons to AgroMechs, even hover and
  wheeled police cruisers or civilian vehicles conscripted to the military: the support
  vehicle is the true backbone of any military machine.</p><p>Built using the construction
  rules in <i>TechManual</i> and <i>Tactical Operations</i>, <strong>Technical Readout:
  Vehicle Annex</strong> provides a never-before-seen look at the support vehicles
  behind the militaries of every faction, as well as a slice of daily life in the
  <i>BattleTech</i> universe. This revised edition has been updated with an overview
  of the Jihad and Republic era, up to 3084, covering its effects on support vehicle
  production and various efforts to use them as weapons of war.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-technical-readout-vehicle-annex-revised-pdf">Buy
