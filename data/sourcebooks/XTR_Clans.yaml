description: '<p><strong>Beyond the Cutting Edge</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The fires
  of the Jihad have savaged the collective military-industrial complexes of the Inner
  Sphere, touching even the occupation zones claimed by the heirs of Kerensky. Almost
  simultaneously, chaos has erupted at home, a conflagration that has ultimately cut
  the invaders off from their distant homelands. Severed from their roots, and stranded
  among the hordes of "barbarian" Houses, the Clans must push their technological
  capabilities to their limit and evolve--or perish with the weak as war rages on
  across the universe.</p><p><strong>Experimental Technical Readout: The Clans</strong>
  samples a number of new designs being produced by the various Clan powers who now
  call the Inner Sphere home. Infusing a new wave of advanced Clan technology into
  the older models at their disposal, most of the designs featured in this book incorporate
  a mix of modern technologies and design standards the likes of which the Inner Sphere
  has yet to face in open battle. Statistics and Record Sheets are included for 13
  new experimental BattleMechs, ProtoMechs, vehicles, aerospace fighters, and battle
  armor are presented in this book, ready for play in advanced <i>BattleTech</i> games.</p><p><br><a
