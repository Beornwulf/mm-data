description: '<p><strong>The Gray Death Legion</strong>: Mercenaries betrayed by their
  employer and betrayed from within. Mariks and ComStar oppose them. Can Grayson Carlyle
  lead his command out of the trap that has ensnared them? Only quick, decisive action
  and determination will see them survive overwhelming odds.</p><p><strong>Helm</strong>:
  A world of glaciers, tundra, rock-filled deserts, barren seas, and an ancient Star
  League secret. That secret could destroy the Legion and move humanity another step
  closer toward darkness. Or one step closer toward salvation. Helm and humanityâ€™s
  future lay in the grasp of an outlawed mercenary unit.</p><p><strong>Turning Points</strong>:
  Helm uses <i>Chaos Campaign</i> rules to give players the option of fighting individual
  battles or to follow a campaign arc. Included are a detailed map of the world of
  Helm, a run down of the forces involved, and scenario tracks recreating the battles
  on Helm.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-turning-points-helm">Buy
