description: '<p><strong>Arisen From The Ashes</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the
  FedCom Civil War swung into high gear and conflict swept through the Inner Sphere,
  the need for additional war materials was paramount. However, unlike many companies
  which produced new, but expensive, BattleMechs, a new upstart company, Vicore Industries,
  took a different route. By taking centuries old machines and upgrading both their
  physical as well as technological capabilities, Vicore almost single handedly started
  a revolution that provided a relatively cheap means to bring "new" BattleMechs to
  the field commanders desperate for more assets.</p><p>Classic BattleTech Technical
  Readout: Project Phoenix provides descriptions, game statistics and illustrations
  for twenty-nine classic BattleMechs that have been upgraded both in appearance and
  technology. Also, for the first time in any technical readout, additional illustrations
  representing all the variants for every design in the book are also included.</p><p>Note:
  The record sheets for these designs can be found in the PDF, <a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-record-sheet-total-warfare-style-3085-project-phoe">BattleTech:
