description: '<p><strong>The March of Progress</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Jihad
  is over. A new Republic has been born. In the wake of one of humanity''s greatest
  conflicts, the Inner Sphere, Periphery and Clans must adapt to new political and
  industrial realities--a new balance of power. But changes on the map are only the
  beginning. The Word of Blake''s war has scattered a new wave of technological progress
  across nearly every realm, giving rise to a new generation of combat units. Only
  the sheer devastation of the relentless fighting has slowed the arms race that is
  sure to come... but for how long?</p><p><strong>Technical Readout: Prototypes</strong>
  introduces the wave of new battle armor, vehicle, ''Mech, and aerospace units that
  debuted in the years after the birth of the Republic of the Sphere. Featuring technologies
  rarely seen outside the testing fields or Solaris arenas, these new war machines
  provide a peek at the new age to come as mankind faces a new century.</p><p>For
  use with <i>BattleTech</i>, <i>Total Warfare</i>, <i>Tactical Operations</i>, and
