description: '<p>"Those who break faith with the Unity shall go down to darkness."<br><br>While
  the Great Houses of the Inner Sphere decimated each other over the shattered remains
  of the Star League and slid into the technological dark age of the Succession Wars,
  the Clans of Kerensky entered into a golden era of prosperity. Bereft of Nicholas
  Kerenskyâ€™s leadership, the Clans pushed their technological capabilities to their
  limits, developing devastating new weapons and technologies and flooding the battlefields
  of the Pentagon and Kerensky Cluster with powerful war machines as they trialed
  each other for supremacy.<br><br><strong>Technical Readout: Golden Century</strong>
  unveils the weapons and technologies developed during a pivotal era in Clan history,
  when the Clans came of age and matured into what they are today. Technical Readout:
  Golden Century debuts the production and custom machines used by the Children of
  Kerensky in the early twenty-ninth and thirtieth centuries. Statistics and Record
  Sheets are included for 29 new advanced and experimental BattleMechs, OmniMechs,
  vehicles, aerospace, battle armor and WarShip units ready for play. In addition,
  a complete section covers the experimental designs introduced by the nascent Clans
  immediately following the Pentagon campaign.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-technical-readout-golden-century">Buy
