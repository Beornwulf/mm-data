  <p><b>Shrapnel: The Official BattleTech Magazine</b> surges onward, waging wars
  that will decide the fate of the BattleMech-dominated future of the 31st century
  and beyond! Follow a quest for quick cash that yields unusual Star League relics.
  Commiserate with an aging MechWarrior convinced he is cursed with the devil’s luck—which
  is about to run out. Listen to the tale of how mercenary commander Ace Darwin obtained
  his iconic ’Mech—but how much of his story is true? Within these pages, you will
  visit Terra after the dawn of the ilClan era, venture into the postwar period of
  the Aurigan Coalition, and travel to the far-flung worlds of the Scorpion Empire
  in the Deep Periphery. Then you will dive into the intrigue and vice of Solaris
  VII in the beginning of a new, four-part serial novel._x000D_

  <p>Choose your plan of attack with technical readouts, after-action reports, a deep
  dive into plasma technology, a treatise on covert-ops poisons, and a look at Free
  Worlds League politics, along with playable scenarios and more—all loaded into your
  autocannon by both BattleTech veterans and new voices from the Inner Sphere:_x000D_
