  _x000D_

  <p>On the faraway Clan Homeworlds during the Golden Century, Nicholas Kerensky’s
  vision of the Clans has blossomed into a thriving, varied culture where the warrior
  is esteemed above all…and MechWarriors, in their armored war machines, are at the
  pinnacle of Clan hierarchy._x000D_

  _x000D_

  <p>The eighteen Clans have existed in relative technological parity as well…until
  the day Clan Coyote fields a radical new ’Mech that gives them the edge on any battlefield—the
  OmniMech. Supremely customizable thanks to its modular design, the OmniMech threatens
  to upend the delicate balance of power among the Clans…and its secrets become a
  hotly contested prize._x000D_

  _x000D_

  <p>In the annual Trial of Possession for the OmniMech technology, the Jade Falcons
  have won the right to challenge the Coyotes first. But along with the upcoming ’Mech
  battle, a shadowy force is willing to do whatever is necessary to ensure that the
  Falcons succeed…even if it requires the sacrifice of cherished ideals…_x000D_
