description: '<p>Across the reinvigorated Federated Suns, the call goes out: the time
  has come to retake the jewel of New Avalon from the Dragon, and throw back the Draconis
  Combine invaders. But the demands of war and politics will test the fragile alliance
  between First Prince Julian Davion and Prince’s Champion Erik Sandoval-Groell, and
  threaten to renew the chaos they seek to conquer.</p><p>The Rasalhague Dominion,
  so long a bastion of stability and internal harmony, greets the news of the ilClan’s
  accession with anything but a united front. Between those who believe that joining
  the newborn Star League is the Dominion’s destiny, and those not willing to deny
  the power and promise of their fusion culture, a single vote could secure a bright
  new future, or ignite the flames of violence.</p><p><i>Dominions Divided</i> is
  a <i>BattleTech</i> sourcebook providing full details of the events within the Federated
  Suns, Draconis Combine, and Rasalhague Dominion from 3151 to mid-3152. Included
  are a full historical summary of events in those regions of space, personality and
  unit profiles of key players—many appearing here for the first time–and game information
  along with a glossy campaign map to bring it all to your <i>BattleTech</i> tabletop.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a
