description: '<p><strong>TESTING THE FRINGES</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No world
  has been left untouched by the Jihad. As the great states battle for survival against
  their fanatic enemies, the fringes have been left to their own devices, at risk
  for any number of plots by nearby opportunists and marauding brigands. While some
  interstellar companies have come to see these frontiers as a potential new customer
  base for defensive hardware, there are also many others on these "back woods" worlds
  who have called upon their own resourcefulness, to bring new weapons to bear in
  the war against eternal chaos.</p><p><strong>Experimental Technical Readout: Boondocks</strong>
  samples the custom and prototype designs that have begun to turn up on the lesser-known
  worlds of the BattleTech universe. Each design featured in this book incorporates
  some of the latest technologies developed by the realms of the Inner Sphere as the
  war against the Word of Blake continues. These technologies--first described in
  <i>Tactical Operations</i>--have yet to achieve widespread production, but each
  has been prototyped and rushed to the field for their desperate consumers. Statistics
  and Record Sheets are included for 13 new experimental BattleMechs, vehicles, and
  aerospace units presented in this book, ready for play in advanced <i>BattleTech</i>
  games.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-experimental-technical-readout-boondocks-pdf">Buy
