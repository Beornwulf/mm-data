description: <p>Once a sleepy Lyran backwater noted primarily for its interesting
  local dialect and minor industrial exports, Kandersteg found itself much closer
  to the front lines during the first Clan Invasion of the 3050s. Now, a century later,
  Kandersteg is thrust into the spotlight in the wake of the Clans' move to conquer
  Terra, where it finds itself in the center of a budding Tamar liberation movement
  and home to a fast-growing Hiring Hall as mercenaries from around the Inner Sphere
  prepare to take the fight to the enemy.<br><br><i><strong>Touring the Stars</strong></i>
  is a whistle-stop tour of the universe! Every system and planet where mankind treads
  in the <i><strong>BattleTech</strong></i> universe has a story, for those with the
  drive to explore it. Take a tour of the stars humanity now calls home, experience
  awesome new worlds, immerse yourself in the local civilization, and prepare to do
  battle in exotic locales.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-touring-the-stars-kandersteg">Buy
