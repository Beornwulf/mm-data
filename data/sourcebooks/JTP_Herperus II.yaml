description: '<p>One of the most important manufacturing worlds in the Inner Sphere,
  Hesperus II was a primary objective of the Word of Blake’s Operation STEEL HAMMER.
  The plan was designed to disrupt the Lyran Alliance’s economic and industrial base.
  Long before attempting to seize Hesperus II, the Word concocted a lengthy invasion
  plan to weaken Lyran defenses. The Blakists aimed to succeed where other invaders
  had failed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jihad Turning Points: Hesperus II</strong>
  fleshes out all the details of the conflict surrounding this pivotal world published
  in various Jihad Plot Sourcebooks. Additionally, players can join one of the myriad
  of units fighting for ultimate control of one of the Inner Sphere’s best-known factory
  worlds. This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the
  option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into
  their own campaigns, and even creating their own scenarios with optional rules to
  give their games a “Hesperan flavor.” This PDF-exclusive book includes a detailed
  map of Hesperus II, a comprehensive list of the forces involved on Hesperus II during
  its brief occupation, and several Tracks for players can use to run simple lance-on-lance
  battles or stage a complete world-wide invasion. The only limit is the players’
  imagination.</p><p><br><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/111345/BattleTech-Jihad-Turning-Points-Hesperus-II">Buy
