description: '<b>THE ENEMY OF MY ENEMY...</b><p><p>_x000D_

  _x000D_

  Since appearing in the Inner Sphere, the frenzied Clans have overwhelmed every planet
  they’ve invaded, brutally crushing any opposing force. Their race is selectively
  bred for combat. Their technology is superior to anything the Inner Sphere possesses.
  Nothing the Great Houses have can stop them. Humanity’s only hope—an alliance of
  mortal enemies—may be doomed.<p>_x000D_

  _x000D_

  The Clan invaders have chosen their next objective—Luthien, capital of the Draconis
  Combine. House Kurita must now fight for survival on its homeworld.<p>_x000D_

  _x000D_

  Hanse Davion is presented with a situation undreamt of...the final defeat of the
  Dragon itself. Should he attack his distracted foe and destroy the enemy his family
  has battled for over 300 years? Or should he reinforce a fellow House of the Inner
  Sphere against a force that Davion and the Federated Commonwealth might not otherwise
  defeat when their time comes?<p>_x000D_

  _x000D_

  And even if the Houses should somehow agree to stand together against the Clan menace,
  another just as dangerous threat lurks within their very midst. ComStar, the semi-mystic
  sect that controls interstellar communication, schemes to hurl House Davion, House
  Kurita, and the Clans into a devastating war that will leave ComStar in a position
  to dominate the Inner Sphere..._x000D_
