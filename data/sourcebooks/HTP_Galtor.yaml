description: '<p><strong>A Star League Prize!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Several
  years before titanic events erupted into the Fourth Succession War, the last significant
  battle of the Third Succession War took place in 3025, on the sleepy, border world
  of Galtor.</p><p>Hanse Davion, Prince of the Federated Suns, attempted to regain
  control of the stalemate along his border with House Kurita by leaking the existence
  of a fake hidden Star League cache on Galtor. Once the Dragon took the bait, House
  Davion forces would spring their trap. Yet when a real Star League cache is found,
  all bets are off and Davion forces are fighting for their lives, while attempting
  to secure the ancient ruins that could hold ancient treasures!</p><p><strong>Historical
  Turning Points: Galtor</strong> extracts the sourcebook details from the classic
  Galtor Campaign scenario book and represents it in the phenomenally successful Jihad
  Turning Points PDF exclusive format. Return to an earlier time in BattleTech history,
  when centuries of Succession Wars have honed an animosity to a razor''s edge between
  the Great Houses of Davion and Kurita! This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign
  rules and gives players the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign
  arc, inserting it into their own campaigns and even create their own scenarios.
  This PDF exclusive includes a detailed map of the world of Galtor, a run down of
  the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks that players can use to
  run simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage up to a world-wide invasion. Only the
  players'' imaginations are the limits.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-historical-turning-points-galtor-pdf">Buy
