  Between the collapse of the Terran Alliance, and the rise of the First Star League,
  humankind was scattered among the worlds of the Inner Sphere. Driven by their own
  ambitions and united by fear of their neighbors, mighty star empires rose up from
  the ashes of abandoned colonies, absorbing the remains of mankind''s interstellar
  exodus, and gave rise to the noble Houses of the Inner Sphere.<p>_x000D_

  _x000D_

  Driven by greed, fear, and dreams of glory, these Houses were at war by the dawn
  of the twenty-fifth century. The decades of conflict would leave no realm untouched,
  and forever altered the course of human destiny.<p>_x000D_
