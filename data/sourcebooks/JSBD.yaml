  Chandrasekhar Kurita has spent his life hunting for ancient secrets. Almost as soon
  as the Word of Blake formed in 3052, "Uncle Chandy" put his vast network of spies
  and his massive wealth toward digging behind their facade and now, two decades later,
  Uncle Chandy has discovered more than he ever thought possible. Now he''s using
  that knowledge to send a coalition of forces against one of the Blakists'' hidden
  five worlds: the Ruins of Gabriel. More importantly, he''s found a connection to
  the single greatest mystery in the last half-millennia. Aware he''s almost guaranteed
  his death at the hands of a Blakist fanatic, Uncle Chandy knows the time has come
  to stand in the light and reveal the secrets that will change the tide of the Jihad!<p>_x000D_

  current universe-shaking Jihad storyline, providing more "hard facts" than any book
  to date. Detailed information on the opening years of the Jihad, including maps
  of the most significant conflicts; a current 3075 "Around the Sphere" in the same
  vein as the <i>Jihad Hot Spots</i> series provides up-to-date information on the
  latest happenings; biographies of more than twenty individuals important to the
  Jihad; a complete description of all Word of Blake forces, including unit logos;
  and the hidden history of Clan Wolverine and the Minnesota Tribe revealed! A complete
  rules section rounds the book out, with game play rules for taking any Word of Blake
  division into the field, construction rules for primitive units, and new ''Mechs,
  including Clan Wolverine''s Mercury II, Pulverizer, and Stag, the primitive Dervish
