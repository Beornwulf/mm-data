  Precariously poised between the fierce eagle of House Marik and the voracious dragon
  of House Kurita, House Steiner fights a desperate battle to protect the worlds,
  industries, and peoples of the Lyran Commonwealth. One of the five Successor States
  of the fallen Star League, the Commonwealth is noted for having the strongest economy
  and the weakest military leadership of all the realms. Nevertheless, its clenched
  fist is a symbol of defiance to those who would swallow the Commonwealth whole.<p>_x000D_

  Compiled from ComStar records both ancient and modern comes this sourcebook on the
