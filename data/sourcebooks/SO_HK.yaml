description: '<p>Death From Above. No words better describe Hellion Keshik, the bodyguard
  Trinary for Clan Goliath Scorpion''s saKhan. Few formations conjure terror amongst
  their enemies more than this assemblage of warriors. Forged from tattered remnants
  of two Clans, one absorbed and the other abjured, Hellion Keshik welded their disparate
  philosophies into one. As the tip of the spear for Hellion Galaxy, the Keshik does
  more than protect the saKhan. These warriors train endlessly and fight savagely
  like no others in the Scorpion Touman. The Keshik has never tasted defeat, because
  victory is so sweet.<br><br><strong>Spotlight On: Hellion Keshik</strong> includes
  a Unit History, Personalities, Personnel Rosters, Mission Tracks, and data for use
  with all scales of <i>BattleTech</i> play.</p>'
