  The march of technology across BattleTech’s eras is relentless—but some BattleMech
  designs never die. Each installment of this PDF-only series not only includes a
  brand new BattleMech or OmniMech, but also details Classic ‘Mech designs from both
  the Inner Sphere and the Clans, now fully rebuilt with Dark Age technology (3085
  and beyond). Allowing beloved units redesigned for the BattleTech: Clan Invasion
  Kickstarter to be competitive on “modern” battlefields, this series also includes
  in-universe development notes, battle histories, notable pilots, and record sheets
  for each ‘Mech.<br>_x000D_
