description: '<p><strong>The Jihad</strong> In November 3067 the Second Star League
  disbanded. The Word of Blake--a splinter group of ComStar--had been on the verge
  of joining in fulfillment of ancient prophecies. Denied their dream, the Blakists
  sought to preserve the Star League against the follies of the Houses, but its fanaticism
  manifested this noble goal as the Jihad: a horrific war that has pitted every faction
  against each other and even themselves. Against such an anvil, new cutting edge
  machines of war are marched into the fire. The discovery of an ancient Hegemony
  Memory Core graphically showcases the desperation of the conflict, as primitive
  ''Mechs not seen on a battlefield since the dawn of ''Mech production over a half
  millennia ago once again appear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Classic BattleTech Technical
  Readout: 3075</strong> provides a comprehensive look at the latest machines of war
  debuting during the Jihad: from ''Mechs to battle armor, Support Vehicles to DropShips
  and more. In addition, a complete "Age of War" section covers the Terran Hegemony
  and each of the five Great Houses during the Age of War, including the very first
  BattleMechs produced by each faction and how such machines are starting to appear
  once more. Each military vehicle is illustrated in detail, accompanied by a description
  of its history, capabilities, game stats, and some of the unit''s most famous pilots.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br><a
