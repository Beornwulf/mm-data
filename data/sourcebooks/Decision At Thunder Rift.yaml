description: '<p><strong>THE EPIC FIRST NOVEL OF THE LEGENDARY SCIENCE FICTION SERIES...</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thirty
  meters tall, seventy tons of quick-striding death and destruction, the armored war
  machines called BattleMechs are the front line forces of the crumbling star empire
  locked in the horror of the endless Succession Wars. Their pilots are MechWarriors,
  31st-Century knights riding armored machines powerful enough to take a city apart.</p><p>Grayson
  Death Carlyle had been training to be a MechWarrior since he was 10 years old, but
  his graduation came sooner than expected. With his friends and family dead and his
  father''s regiment destroyed, young Grayson finds himself stranded on a world turned
  hostile. Now he must learn the hardest lesson of all: it takes more than a BattleMech
  to make a MechWarrior... But to claim that title, all Grayson has to do is go out
  and capture one of those giant killing machines...if it doesn''t kill him first.</p><p><br><a
