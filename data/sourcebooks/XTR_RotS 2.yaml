description: '<p>The year is 3136. Just when it seemed certain that the Republic of
  the Sphere had led the Inner Sphere to a true era of peace, all hopes lie in ruins.
  Communications have broken down, separatist factions run amok on defenseless worlds,
  the Great Houses are saber-rattling like in the worst of times, and the Clans are
  once more on the prowl. Withering in the chaos, much of the Republic has fallen
  back behind the inscrutable barrier known as Fortress Republic, while its severed
  Remnant scrambles for its very survival. Bereft of their central authority, the
  surviving warriors of the RAF face uncertain times, surrounded now by enemies whose
  war machines have caught up with the technological leaps of the past decade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Experimental
  Technical Readout: Republic II</strong> samples production and custom machines that
  have appeared in the BattleTech universe by the early decades of the thirty-second
  century. Each unit featured in this book incorporates some of the new technologies
  that debuted in Tactical Operations--now employed by the armed forces of the Republic
  of the Sphere and its contemporaries. Statistics and Record Sheets are included
  for 13 new advanced and experimental BattleMechs, vehicles, and aerospace and battle
  armor units, ready for play in <i>BattleTech</i> games up to the year 3136.</p><p><br><a
