description: 'During the Fourth Succession War, the fiercest fighting lay along the
  contentious Draconis March, pitting the elite DCMS not against the forces of the
  Federated Suns, but against a singular mercenary enemy: Wolf''s Dragoons. The firestorm
  that erupted on Misery fanned the hatred of Coordinator Takashi Kurita, who gave
  his now-famous "Death to Mercenaries!" edict and directed nearly the entire might
  of the Galedon Military District against the three worlds garrisoned by the Dragoons.<p><p>_x000D_
