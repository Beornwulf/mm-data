  By the 31st century, war has raged in the Successor States for over 200 years. In
  this ongoing conflict, the mercenary soldier has ample opportunity to seek his fortune
  under the banner of one of the Great Houses--a career fraught with danger but rich
  in potential rewards._x000D_

  <b>The Mercenary''s Handbook</b> is a BattleTech and MechWarrior, First Edition
  supplement describing the mercenary way of life. It details everything from troop
  capabilities to a mercenary unit''s expenses, and from the ins and outs of contract
  negotiations to the nature of 31st century warfare. Commentary and views on the
  Succession Wars mercenary provide a solid background for gamers who need to learn
  the basics of the business of war, while game rules translate these ideas into simple
  systems for creating a merc outfit, finding and signing with employers, and resolving
  an entire military campaign._x000D_

  Admired as a consumate professional yet reviled as a hireling loyal only to money,
  the successful mercenary needs more than combat skill to ply his trade. If you have
  the wit, the business skills, the political wisdom, and the tactical genius to become
  a mercenary leader, The Mercenary''s Handbook is for you!_x000D_
