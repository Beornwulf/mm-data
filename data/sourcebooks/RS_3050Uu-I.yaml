description: '<p>Technological Renaissance Over two hundred and fifty years ago, General
  Aleksandr Kerensky departed human-occupied space, taking three-quarters of the Star
  League Defense Force with him. They returned in 3050 as the Clans: a society dedicated
  to the highest warrior ideals and bent on conquering the Inner Sphere. With their
  OmniMechs and superior technology, they proved almost unstoppable until their defeat
  at Tukayyid and subsequent 15 year truce. The year is now 3071, and the Jihad rages.
  Inner Sphere ''Mechs, hastily upgraded with field modifications to counter the Clans,
  continue to prove their worth. Notable pilots rise to become heroes as new, time
  tested variants--sporting weapons right out of R&amp;D labs--make their presence
  known.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BattleTech Record Sheets: 3050 Upgrades Unabridged,
  Inner Sphere</strong> offers players the record sheets for all the Inner Sphere
  BattleMechs detailed in BattleTech <i>Technical Readout: 3050 Upgrade</i>, over
  250 in total, many variants making their debut here. The Clan and Star League designs
  can be found in <i>BattleTech Record Sheets: 3050 Upgrades Unabridged, Clan and
