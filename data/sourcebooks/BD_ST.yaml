  Deadly aces can be dangerous wildcards on the modern battlefield. Whether they fight
  for money or for a cause, these lone warriors can often sway the tide of battle
  by simply choosing a side and joining the fray. Surviving the Jihad by his wits
  and his will, Salazar Tsakalotos has become one such warrior, a lone wolf who sells
  his services to the highest bidder. His latest contract could send him into battle
  against Devlin Stone''s newly forged Republic of the Sphere, but will it be his
  greatest triumph, or the end of a legend?<p>_x000D_
