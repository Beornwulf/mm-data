description: '<h2>SIGN ON THE DOTTED LINE…</h2><p><i>Shrapnel: The Official BattleTech
  Magazine</i> puts your loyalty to the test amid unrelenting BattleMech combat that
  spans the war-torn battlefields of the 31st century and beyond!<br>The head of a
  security team must seek unusual allies to keep the First Prince of the Federated
  Suns safe from assassination. An aging Elemental warrior imparts lasting lessons
  to a young cadet when pirates threaten everything he holds dear. A young IndustrialMech
  pilot must use the only weapon he knows in the face of rampaging occupiers.</p><p>In
  this issue, you’ll visit the Unwearied Second’s 1,000th birthday celebration, a
  gala attended by the upper crust of Lyran society. Then roll up your sleeves and
  dive into testing a dangerous but poweful experimental weapon system. Stand firm
  with the Nova Cats, who try to hold back the inevitable tide of destiny, and travel
  to the Mercenary’s Star to navigate through scams and con artists in order to find
  the right outfit to call home.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Sign your contract and seek victory,
  with the help of mercenary-advice articles, technical readouts, unit digests, an
  in-depth look at the true nature of the “Death to Mercenaries” edict, and more—all
