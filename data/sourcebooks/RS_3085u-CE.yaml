description: '<p>In December 3076, Devlin Stone marshaled the nations of the Inner
  Sphere and began Operation SCOUR. The two-year final push to Terra was the bloodiest
  fighting seen in centuries. In the end, Terra had been freed with the Word of Blake
  scattered to the darkest corners of the universe. Stepping into that vacuum, Stone
  forged a new "Terran Hegemony" in The Republic of the Sphere. With the end of the
  Jihad, the survivors are rebuilding their shattered armies, introducing new machines
  to replace those whose factories ceased to exist in the fires of the Jihad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BattleTech
