description: '<p><strong>The Peak of the Golden Age</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before
  the fall of the first Star League, humanity reached a pinnacle of technological
  development that would not be seen again for nearly four centuries. United under
  the aegis of House Cameron, even the states of the Periphery enjoyed a surge of
  industrial and scientific development that would forever be known as mankind''s
  greatest golden age.</p><p>Predictably, many of these innovations were used first
  to perfect the engines of war, a practice that continued even into the League''s
  waning years. Now, unearthed from ancient archives on Terra in the wake of the Jihad,
  examples of some of the more exotic prototypes from the days of the Star League
  have been revealed, each one pushing the envelope of Star League military design.</p><p><strong>Experimental
  Tech Readout: Gunslingers</strong> samples some of the advanced technological experiments
  developed during the peak years of the Star League era. Each design featured in
  this book demonstrates the use of cutting edge Star League equipment on the BattleMechs,
  combat vehicles, and aerospace craft of the day. Statistics and Record Sheets are
  included for 13 BattleMechs, vehicles, and aerospace units presented in this book,
  ready for play in advanced <i>BattleTech</i> games.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-experimental-technical-readout-davion-pdf">Buy
