  Deadly aces can be dangerous wildcards on the modern battlefield. Whether they fight
  for money or for a cause, these lone warriors can often sway the tide of battle
  by simply choosing a side and joining the fray. Hidden on the world of Homestead
  before the war with Hasek''s forces, Sang-wei Jason Zaklan is one such warrior,
  an elite commando in service to the Celestial Throne. But when FedSuns mercenaries
  come calling ahead of schedule, and the local defenders resort to guerrilla war,
  will Zaklan risk his cover and fight them openly, or will he allow countrymen to
  die for the cause?<p>_x000D_
