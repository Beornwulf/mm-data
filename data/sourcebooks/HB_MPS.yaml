description: '<p><strong>THE FRONTIERS OF KNOWN SPACE</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The
  peoples of the Inner Sphere often consider themselves the epitome of technology
  and culture and relegate the denizens of the frontiers of known space to second-class
  citizenry, or worse. And yet it took the combined armies of the Inner Sphere more
  than twenty years to subjugate them during the forming of the first Star League
  half millennia ago.</p><p>Magistracy of Canopus, Taurian Concordat, Marian Hegemony,
  Outworlds Alliance and Circinus Federation. Each is a unique star-spanning empire
  whose hardy-people have carved out their freedom with bare hands: an identity they
  will not give up without a fight. Even the Great Houses have begun to learn that
  underestimating these Periphery States is dangerous indeed.</p><p>Handbook: Major
  Periphery States collates the essential history, politics and culture of the Major
  Periphery States into a single volume. More than a mere sourcebook, Handbook: Major
  Periphery States provides rules for both BattleTech and A Time of War: The BattleTech
  RPG game play, including new support vehicles, creatures and more!</p><p><br><a
