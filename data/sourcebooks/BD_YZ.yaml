  Heroes, patriots, soldiers, freedom fighters. The universe is full of them, and
  every realm and military force--from the mightiest Successor State to the humblest
  mercenary band--has its share. In the Capellan Confederation, Sang-wei Arthur Chin
  and his detached lance of MechWarriors--the Youling Zhanshi must try to resist the
  Davion hordes on the world of Homestead. Do they have what it takes to become heroes
  of the Confederation, or will their mission be just another footnote in the annals
  of history?<p>_x000D_
