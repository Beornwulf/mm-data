description: '<p><strong>Critical Errors</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For as long as
  there have been wars, mankind has been on a quest for ever more efficient means
  to kill. Yet even as the technologies improve, there are always missteps, unexpected--and,
  sometimes, unexplained--flaws in engineering that can transform a promising new
  weapon into a setback costing billions of credits, years of progress, and perhaps
  even a few lives.</p><p><strong>Experimental Tech Readout: Boondoggles</strong>
  samples some of the most infamous failures in military experiments made by the Inner
  Sphere and Clan powers throughout history. Each design featured in this book demonstrates
  a disastrous (or merely abandoned) combination of prototype technology or engineering
  employed on BattleMechs, combat vehicles, and aerospace units from the Star League
  age to the Jihad era. Statistics and (where useful) Record Sheets are included for
  14 BattleMechs, vehicles, and aerospace units presented in this book, ready to use
  (if possible) in advanced <i>BattleTech</i> games.</p><p><br><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-experimental-technical-readout-boondoggles-pdf">Buy
