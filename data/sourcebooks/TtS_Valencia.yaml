description: 'Among the isolated Castilian worlds is Valencia: a distant planet of
  turbulent, short seasons, and eerie purple-black foliage. Fresh water was abundant,
  terrestrial crops and animals thrived, and native plants and sea life were edible.
  The only thing that could disrupt this unusual paradise was, of course, humanity._x000D_

  Small conflicts among the first settlers, the Castilians, disrupted the peace of
  Valencia. And then invaders—the “Umayyads”—attacked with never-before-seen giant,
  bipedal robots. A neighboring league of interstellar merchants, the Hansa, never
  allowed the Castilians and Umayyad invaders to find peace. The arrival of Clan Goliath
  Scorpion settled their conflict, and gave Valencia a central place in the Scorpions’
  new Imperio._x000D_
