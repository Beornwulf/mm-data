  _x000D_

  David McCarthy returns to Kathil a hero—one of the few surviving members of the
  First Kathil Uhlans, who fought so fiercely in the war to defeat the Clans. But
  he returns from Clan space with haunting memories of the cost of victory...<p>_x000D_

  _x000D_

  militia on Kathil—and steps into a powder keg. Opposing forces wrangle for control

  WarShip fleet. The Eighth Regimental Combat Team—loyal to Archon Katrina—refuses

  _x000D_

  Caught in the power struggle between supporters of Katrina and those of her brother,
  Victor, McCarthy vows that he won''t fail the people of his home planet, even if
  that means leading his untested MechWarriors against the Eighth''s superior firepower—and
  dredging up a past he''d rather forget..._x000D_
