description: '<p>MechWarriors receive all the glory; aerospace fighters are a close
  second; vehicles are considered the workhorses of any military; infantry are even
  given their day in the sun in the minds of the common citizen. But no battle could
  be waged, nor won, without the mammoth apparatus of support vehicles that feed the
  war machine of the Great Houses. From cargo trucks to tanker airships, airborne
  MASH to communications satellites, armored transport rails to coastal patrol boats,
  hauler exoskeletons to AgroMechs, even hover and wheeled police cruisers or civilian
  vehicles conscripted to the military: the support vehicle is the true backbone of
  any military machine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BattleTech Record Sheets: Vehicle
  Annex, IndustrialMechs &amp; Exoskeletons</strong> offers players the record sheets
  for all the IndustiralMechs and Exoskeletons detailed in BattleTech <i>Technical
