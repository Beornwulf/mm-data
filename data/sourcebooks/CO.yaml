description: <p>Forge your forces and prepare to fight any battle across the Inner
  Sphere! Campaign Operations completes the core rulebook series begun in Total Warfare.
  While previous rulebooks detailed game play at various levels--from a single MechWarrior,
  to a BattleMech company, to entire armies--this final volume focuses on the forces
  a player will build and run through any level of play.<br><br>Campaign Operations
  contains rules for creating and running forces, whether a down-on-their-luck mercenary
  battalion, or a fully-supplied House regiment. The volume also contains complete
  rules for devising solar systems, allowing players to recreate existing star systems
  or craft all-new worlds to challenge each other. The final sections of the book
  bring several options to the table for campaign play. Building off of previous sections
  in Total Warfare and Strategic Operations, the Narrative Campaign, Map-Based Campaign
  and Chaos Campaign rules allow players to build exciting, fun campaigns of almost
  any stripe for their newly-minted forces!</p>
