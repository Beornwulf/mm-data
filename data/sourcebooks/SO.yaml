description: <p>Lift off planet and conquer an entire solar system! Deploy kilometer-long
  WarShips as escorts, first for JumpShips bridging the gulf between stars, then for
  detaching DropShips that burn in system to drop troops onto any battlefield. New
  aerospace tactics will allow you to gain air supremacy to match your grasp of ground
  tactics. Yet the war for a star system is more than a single battle and a commander
  that utilizes his supplies and personnel with skill will survive the numerous battles
  to come.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Strategic Operations</strong> is the one-source
  rulebook for advanced rules aerospace assets that open the entire conquest of a
  solar system. It includes new aerospace movement, combat and advanced aerospace
  unit construction rules, as well as comprehensive maintenance, salvage, repair and
  customization rules. Finally, a complete game system--<i>BattleForce</i>--allows
  players to use their existing miniatures and mapsheets to play quick, fast-paced
  BattleTech games, from companies to battalions and even regiments.</p><p><br><a
