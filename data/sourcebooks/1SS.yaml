description: 'They came from beyond the Periphery, attacking dozens of planets in
  a massive blitzkrieg more devastating than any in the history of warfare. World

  <b>Major Adam Steiner</b>: his unique brand of battlefield tactics earned him a
  transfer to the prestigious Nagelring War College on Tharkad. No sooner had he left
  his home world of Somerset than Clan Jade Falcon attacked, easily conquering the
  planet and capturing his brother, Andrew. Now Adam must forge a ragtag bunch of
  cadets and misfits into a team in order to retake his home and rescue his brother.<p>_x000D_
