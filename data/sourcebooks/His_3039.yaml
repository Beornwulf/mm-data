description: '<p>On 20 August, 3028, Hanse Davion of the Federated Suns launched the
  most successful Succession War in history. Simultaneously capturing half of the
  Capellan Confederation, sidelining the power of House Liao for decades, while launching
  a union that would eventually lead to the formation of the largest, strongest interstellar
  power since the original Star League--the Federated Commonwealth. However the Fox
  could not be content with such success and a scant decade later moved to crush his
  age old enemy, House Kurita. In April 3039, forces of Houses Davion and Steiner
  moved to slay an apparently weakened Dragon only to find the fury of teeth and claws.</p><p>The
  first in a new series, the <strong>Historical: War of 3039</strong> campaign sourcebook
  details the action involving every line unit in this pivotal war. Wave maps and
  full regiment listings convey additional details, while ample campaign rules provide
  a framework allowing players to replay every laser shot and autocannon blast.</p><p><br><a
