description: '<h2>WATCH YOUR SIX!&nbsp;</h2><p><i>Shrapnel: The Official BattleTech
  Magazine</i> brings you more hard-hitting BattleMech action from the heavy-metal
  wars of the 31st century and beyond—but don’t let your guard down!</p><p>A loyal
  Republic of the Sphere MechWarrior must make a life-or-death decision when catastrophic
  news from Terra throws everything into chaos. A sheriff on a Periphery backwater
  planet investigates mysterious murders terrorizing a community. A desperate survivor
  of the Clan Invasion seeks revenge against the Jade Falcons while he still has the
  chance…</p><p>In this issue, you’ll travel to the Hanseatic League in the Deep Periphery,
  where the Scorpion Empire will stop at nothing to obtain a priceless Star League-era
  relic. Then witness the first <i>Marauder</i> built in the new millennium walk off
  the assembly line, face a so-called zombie ’Mech arisen from the grave, and discover
  how to effectively weaponize a BattleMech’s operating system.</p><p>No matter the
  situation, you can stay out of harm’s way by reviewing a most-wanted list of criminals
  and assassins, a roster of the Marian Hegemony’s Legion of the Dead, technical readouts,
  unit and planet digests, playable scenarios, a campaign set in the resource-poor
  wilds of the Third Succession War, and more—all by battle-hardened <i>BattleTech</i>
