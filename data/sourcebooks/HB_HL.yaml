description: '<p><strong>Long live the Confederation!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Assailed
  for centuries by enemies on every side, House Liao''s Capellan Confederation faced
  its own oblivion time and again. Now, nearly forty years since the realm teetered
  on the very brink of collapse, the Confederation has returned, reclaiming the pride
  and unity lost when the armies of Steiner and Davion rolled across their worlds
  to shatter them. Led by the crafty and charismatic Sun-Tzu Liao, and embracing the
  spirit of Xin Sheng--rebirth--House Liao once again has become a political and military
  power to be reckoned with, defying those who would see them fail, and deadly to
  all who oppose them.</p><p><strong>Handbook: House Liao</strong> compiles the history,
  politics, and cultures of the Inner Sphere''s smallest--and perhaps least understood--Great
  House. This sourcebook also includes game rules for use with <i>Total Warfare</i>,
  <i>Tactical Operations</i> and <i>A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG</i>, including
  new support vehicles, equipment, creatures, and more!</p><p><i>Handbook: House Liao</i>
  continues the faction-based Handbook series that updates the political, economic,
  and historical details of the major realms in the BattleTech universe.</p><p><br><a
