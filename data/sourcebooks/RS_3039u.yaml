description: '<p><strong>The Succession Wars</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2781 the
  Star League was officially abandoned, ending a two hundred year-long Golden Age.
  In 2785 the Successor Lords launched a series of massive conflicts that would rage
  for centuries and become known as The Succession Wars. Such endless warfare has
  taken its toll and by the Fourth Succession War of 3028, the technology employed
  on the battlefields is a mere shadow of the height of the Star League. However,
  the discovery of the Helm Memory Core is beginning to unlock such sought-after secrets,
  with new BattleMechs and experimental technologies starting to make a debut for
  the first time in centuries.</p><p><strong>BattleTech Record Sheets: 3039 Unabridged</strong>
  offers players the record sheets for all the ''Mechs and Combat Vehicles detailed
  in <i>BattleTech Technical Readout: 3039</i>, over 480 in total, many variants making
  their debut here.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-record-sheet-3039-unabridged-pdf">Buy
