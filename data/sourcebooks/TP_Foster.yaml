description: '<p>Death to the dishonorable! Eager to take revenge on the devious Smythe-Jewels,
  Clans Coyote and Hell’s Horses announced a Trial of Possession for all of the Fire
  Mandrill Kindraa’s holdings and legacies. The no holds barred campaign saw innovative
  strategies and state-of-the-art technology come into play in the Kindraa’s fight
  for survival. Desperate maneuvers and sly battle plans swung the battle back and
  forth. Turning Points: Foster details the fate of Kindraa Smythe-Jewel in a titanic
  struggle in the Kerensky Cluster during the Golden Century.<br><br><i><strong>Turning
  Points: Foster</strong></i> uses Chaos Campaign rules to give players the option
  of fighting individual battles or to follow a campaign arc. Included are a detailed
  map of the world of Foster, a run down of the forces involved, and scenario tracks
