description: '<p>Nine years since the death of the Second Star League, the Word of
  Blake''s holy war against all of humanity rages on. But new heroes, and new alliances
  have been forged between interstellar nations of the Inner Sphere and the Clans,
  setting aside centuries of distrust and hatred to unite as never before against
  the common enemy. Emerging from shattered realms, the allied coalition has finally
  found the strength to turn the tide, and now the Word and its allies are on the
  defensive. But even as the allies prepare for the inevitable finale, the Word''s
  unseen Master and his fanatical minions won''t fall without a fight!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jihad
  Hot Spots: 3076</strong> continues the Jihad plot book series started with Blake
  Ascending, bringing readers into the raging conflict of the war between the Word
  of Blake and the Inner Sphere. Seen from the eyes of those who fight and die in
  this epic struggle, this book includes articles and intelligence excerpts from across
  the Inner Sphere, along with additional rules and campaign tracks for both <i>BattleTech</i>
  and <i>A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG</i> games, from the unwilling allies of
  the Blakist war machine, to the experimental technologies that gave the Word its
  incredible--if costly--edge for years, to several new BattleMechs, vehicles, and
  combat spacecraft that debuted in the midst of this turning point in the war.</p><p><br><a
