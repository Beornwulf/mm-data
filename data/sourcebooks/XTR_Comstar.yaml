description: '<p><strong>The Order''s Projects</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For ComStar,
  the Clan Invasion sparked a Schism that was, perhaps, a long time coming. When the
  Jihad erupted, the self-appointed guardians of interstellar communications and the
  lost technologies of the Star League found itself at war with its brethren on a
  scale that even the mighty Com Guards could not overcome. As the Word of Blake''s
  war against humanity collapsed on itself, so too did the white-clad warriors of
  ComStar''s military might, their strength and prestige evaporated by the loss of
  Blessed Terra and the long-bitter bitter Jihad. Answering now to a new order on
  Terra, ComStar''s wartime experiments have come to light--including new tools of
  battle intended for use against the zealots of Blake.</p><p><strong>Experimental
  Technical Readout: ComStar</strong> samples the custom and prototype designs that
  were developed in the testing labs and top-secret proving grounds of ComStar''s
  scattered military. Each design featured in this book incorporates some of the latest
  technologies developed by the realms of the Inner Sphere as the war against the
  Word of Blake waged on. These technologies--first described in <i>Tactical Operations</i>--have
  only begun to achieve widespread production, but each has been prototyped and rushed
  to the field for their desperate consumers. Statistics and Record Sheets are included
  for 13 new experimental BattleMechs, vehicles, aerospace units.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-experimental-technical-readout-comstar-pdf">Buy
