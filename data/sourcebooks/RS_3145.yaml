description: '<p>The great experiment that was the Republic of the Sphere has failed.
  Withdrawn behind the Fortress walls, the once-great power has become a silent, opaque
  remnant of its former glory. Without its influence, old hatreds have risen anew.
  As war once more rages across the Inner Sphere, new equipment strides across ancient
  battlefields. Technology, once stagnated by trade restrictions and peace treaties,
  now surges forward again, testing these new machines in the fierce crucible of war.<br><br>BattleTech:
  Record Sheets: 3145 offers players the record sheets for ‘Mechs, Combat Vehicles,
  Battle Armor, and Aerospace designs from BattleTech: Technical Readout: 3145—including
  those from the New Tech, New Upgrades section.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-record-sheets-3145">Buy
