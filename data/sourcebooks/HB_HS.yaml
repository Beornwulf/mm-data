description: '<p>For centuries, the merchant princes of the Lyran Commonwealth survived
  as much through economic might as by the cloak and dagger, steadily growing in strength
  until their influence could be felt across the Inner Sphere. Now emerging from the
  ruins of a short-lived alliance and a bloody civil war, a bold new identity has
  taken hold of the people united under the mighty fist of House Steiner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kicking
  off a new series, <strong>Handbook: House Steiner</strong> brings the essential
  history, politics, and culture of one of the Inner Sphere''s most powerful nations
  to life for a new generation of Classic BattleTech players. More than a mere sourcebook,
  <i>Handbook: House Steiner</i> provides rules for both <i>BattleTech</i> and <i>Classic
  BattleTech RPG</i> campaigns, including new personal equipment, creatures, life
  paths, and more--all tailored for players and campaigns based on the Lyran state!</p><p><br><a
