description: '<p><strong>PUSH YOUR LUCK!</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Shrapnel: The
  Official BattleTech Magazine</i> gives you the weapons you need to triumph when
  battlefield tragedy strikes and the odds are stacked against you. Forge on through
  the unforgiving BattleMech warfare of the 31st century and beyond!</p><p>Two brothers
  on opposite sides of an Inner Sphere-wide war run into each other at the flashpoint
  of a local struggle. A captured wet-navy vessel patrolling a critical river stands
  alone against the Draconis Combine’s oppressive occupation of Verthandi. A group
  of friends on a dying planet in the Davion Outback undertake a risky and dangerous
  mission to escape the system on the last departing DropShip, and a young mercenary
  on his first assignment must choose which inevitable losses will weigh less on his
  conscience.</p><p>In this issue, you’ll charge headlong into danger in the cockpit
  of a fragile but fleet ’Mech that loves to run at full throttle. Then you’ll confront
  incredible four-against-one odds in a vicious gladiatorial event that will be talked
  about for decades to come. Wander into a vast megaforest where brutal Marian Hegemony
  troops could spring an ambush at any moment, then wade through a mist-filled city
  guarded a mysterious protector who will stop at nothing to defend their home.</p><p>Burn
  some sage, grab your rabbit’s foot, and knock on wood as you march on through bad
  luck with a look at a cursed cooling suit, the logs of a JumpShip that misjumped
  on Friday the 13th, a guide to unique battlefield geography, a peek at the culture
  and Machiavellian politics of the Raven Alliance, a Unit Digest for the hard-luck
  mercenaries of Wilson’s Hussars, along with technical readouts, playable scenarios,
  RPG adventures, and more—all by <i>BattleTech</i> veterans and some newcomers:&nbsp;</p><p>Bryan
