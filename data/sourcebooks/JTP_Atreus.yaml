description: '<p><strong>ATREUS CAST DOWN</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite centuries
  of unrest, the Free Worlds League (formed in 2271) is the oldest of all the Great
  Houses. Its capital, Atreus, colonized during humankind''s initial exodus to the
  stars, is held as the ideal of the democracy prized by the people of the League.</p><p>Then
  came the Jihad.</p><p><strong>Jihad Turning Points: Atreus</strong> fleshes out
  the details of the conflict surrounding this pivotal world published in various
  Jihad Plot Sourcebooks. Additionally, players can join one of the myriad of forces
  fighting for control--and survival--of the Free Worlds League''s capital world.</p><p>This
  campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting
  individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into their own campaigns
  and even create their own scenarios with optional rules to give their games a ˆ_Ñ??Atreus
  flavor.ˆ? The ebook includes a detailed map of the world of Atreus, a run down of
  the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks that players can use to
  run simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage up to a world-wide invasion. Only the
  players'' imaginations are the limits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/05-battletech-jihad-turning-points-atreus-pdf-exclusive">Buy
