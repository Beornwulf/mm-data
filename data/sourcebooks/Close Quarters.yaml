description: '<p>Resourceful, ruthless, beautiful, apparently without fear, Scout
  Lieutenant Cassie Suthorn of Camacho''s Caballeros is as consummately lethal as
  the giant BattleMechs she lives to hunt. Only one other person in the freewheeling
  mercenary regiment has a hint of the demons which drive her. When the Caballeros
  sign on to guard Coordinator Theodore Kurita''s corporate-mogul cousin in the heart
  of the Draconis Combine, they think they''ve got the perfect gig: low risk and high
  pay. Cassie alone suspects that danger waits among the looming bronze towers of
  Hachiman--and when the yakuza and the dread ISF form a devil''s alliance to bring
  down Chandrasekhar Kurita, only Cassie''s unique skills can save her regiment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All
  she has to do is confront her darkest nightmares.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-legends-close-quarters-digital">Buy
