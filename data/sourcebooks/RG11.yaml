description: 'The march of technology across BattleTech’s eras is relentless—but some
  BattleMech designs never die. Each installment of this PDF-only series not only
  includes a brand new BattleMech or OmniMech, but also details Classic ’Mech designs
  from both the Inner Sphere and the Clans, now fully rebuilt with Dark Age technology
  (3085 and beyond). Allowing beloved units redesigned for the BattleTech: Clan Invasion
  crowd funding campaign to be competitive on “modern” battlefields, this series also
  includes in-universe development notes, battle histories, notable pilots, and record
  sheets for each ’Mech. Released as a series of 22 PDF-only documents through the
  end of 2020 and early 2021, many ’Mechs featured in this series will be collected
  as a single print volume upon its completion._x000D_
