  Illuminati. Genecaste. Order of Cincinnatus. Irian Corporate Cabal. Behind the House
  thrones and Clan Halls, a hundred or more such secret organizations wield immense
  power. Insinuating their influence into every level of society and government, from
  the Magistracy of Canopus to the Clan homeworlds, these hidden power brokers can
  make life difficult for the average Joe, or shake the very foundations of the Inner
  Sphere.<p>_x000D_

  groups, from this sourcebook or the gamemaster''s imagination, can become the ultimate
