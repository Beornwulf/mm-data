description: '<p><strong>Humanity''s Golden Age!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before
  the treachery of Stefan Amaris, Kerensky''s Exodus, and the Succession Wars, the
  realms of the Inner Sphere were united under the banner of the Star League. As the
  pinnacle of culture and technology, the six Great Houses and four territorial states
  of the League reaped the benefits of universal peace and justice, the fruits of
  their combined efforts enriching the lives of billions across the heavens.</p><p>...Or
  so the legends claim.</p><p>In reality, the Inner Sphere of the 2750s was far from
  serene and light-years away from just. Though admired for its monolithic power,
  the pinnacle of mankind''s greatest experiment--the Star League--stood at a fateful
  crossroads, with feuding House Lords and rebellious territories only waiting for
  every chance to strike against each other.</p><p><strong>Era Report: 2750</strong>
  pierces the luminous veneer of what many Inner Sphere and Clan historians alike
  have considered to be the golden age of BattleTech history: the height of the Star
  League era. Presented as a general overview of the period, rather than a focused
  report on a single conflict, this book includes descriptions of every major Inner
  Sphere faction active before the fateful events described in <i>Historical: Liberation
  of Terra</i>. Notable personalities, military forces, and an overview of the technological
  capabilities of the Star League age are also provided, along with special advanced-level
  rules for campaigns set during this time, whether played using the Total Warfare
  core rules or those found in <i>A Time of War: The BattleTech Role-Playing Game</i>.</p><p><br><a
