description: '<p><strong>The Changing Face of Battle</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In
  3055, a new breed of Inner Sphere BattleMech started rolling off assembling lines,
  ''Mechs specifically designed to counter the Clan invasion--at the same time that
  secondline Clan ''Mechs began to appear. By 3067 those design have become a staple
  of the modern battlefield, giving rise to notable MechWarriors and new variants,
  while the demands of the ever-popular Solaris VII Games have resulted in a plethora
  of new dueling ''Mechs designed using prototype technology.</p><p><i>Technical Readout:
  3055 Upgrade</i> presents the Solaris VII ''Mechs built using prototype technologies.
  Upgraded in appearance and technology, the designs first presented in the Solaris
  VII box set and Solaris: The Reaches are now back in print, along with several new
  Solaris VII designs. In addition to the upgraded appearance of selected Clan designs,
  all the art work for Technical Readout: 3055 Upgrade is new, providing fresh illustrations
  of now classic Inner Sphere BattleMechs and Clan OmniFighters.</p><p>The ''Mechs
  in the Solaris VII BattleMechs section are constructed using select equipment found
  in <i>Tactical Operations</i>. To use those designs, players will need that book.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br><a
