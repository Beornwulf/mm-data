description: '<p><strong>Technological Renaissance</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Over
  two hundred and fifty years ago, General Aleksandr Kerensky departed human-occupied
  space, taking three-quarters of the Star League Defense Force with him. They returned
  in 3050 as the Clans: a society dedicated to the highest warrior ideals and bent
  on conquering the Inner Sphere. With their OmniMechs and superior technology, they
  proved almost unstoppable until their defeat at Tukayyid and subsequent 15 year
  truce. The year is now 3071, and the Jihad rages. Notable pilots rise to become
  heroes as new, time tested variants--sporting weapons right out of R&amp;D labs--make
  their presence known. And over it all, Clan OmniMechs continue to prove they are
  still the cutting edge of technology.</p><p><strong>BattleTech Record Sheets: 3050
  Upgrades Unabridged, Clan &amp; Star League</strong> offers players the record sheets
  for all the Clan OmniMechs and Star League Vehicles, BattleMechs and Aerospace Fighters
  detailed in <i>BattleTech Technical Readout: 3050 Upgrade</i>, over 350 in total,
  many variants making their debut here. The Inner Sphere designs can be found in
  <i>BattleTech Record Sheets: 3050 Upgrades Unabridged</i>, Inner Sphere.</p><p><br><a
