description: '<p>Rendered mostly barren through centuries of warfare, the world of
  Antallos is dotted with death zones, long-lost treasure troves of Star League technology,
  and city-states that once vied for rulership. The rise of Vance Rezak and his Band
  of the Damned stabilized the ancient pirate haven, creating a power base of terror
  along the Combine and Alliance borders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then came Clan Snow Raven.
  Their arrival sparked a war that pitted the recently-arrived Clan against dug-in
  pirates and their new Word of Blake allies. Short and brutal, the conflict forever
  altered the balance of power in the Periphery.</p><p><strong>Historical Turning
  Points: Antallos</strong> looks at the pivotal conflict that removed an ancient
  pirate haven and ushered the Ravens to the Inner Sphere. Return to BattleTech''s
  recent past, where pirates and Blakists fought together to keep a Clan from perching
  along the Inner Sphere''s quietest border.</p><p>This campaign series uses the Chaos
  Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual battles, following
  a campaign arc, or inserting it into their own campaigns. This PDF exclusive includes
  a detailed map of the planet of Antallos, a rundown of the forces involved in the
  conflict, and several tracks that players can use to recreate the entire violent
  conflict on Antallos. Only the players'' imaginations are the limits.</p><p><br><a
