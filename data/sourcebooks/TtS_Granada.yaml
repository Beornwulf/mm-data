description: '<p>Granada: called “The Pumpkin” by everyone but its inhabitants, this
  oblate planet is probably the fastest-spinning world settled by humanity. Like other
  worlds of the Nueva Castilian cluster, it is water-rich and very compatible with
  terrestrial life, allowing humans to thrive.</p><p>Granada has seen key events in
  Castilian history: the collapse of its original central government, the invasion
  of refugees from the Clan worlds, and the birth of the Umayyads. The Seekers of
  Clan Goliath Scorpion have delved into this history, answering burning questions
  of the Umayyads’ mysterious origins.</p><p><i>Touring the Stars</i> is a whistle-stop
  tour of the universe! Every system and planet where mankind treads in the BattleTech
  universe has a story, for those with the drive to explore it. Take a tour of the
  stars humanity now calls home, experience awesome new worlds, immerse yourself in
  the local civilization, and prepare to do battle in exotic locales.</p>'
