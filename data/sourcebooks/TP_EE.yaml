  _x000D_

  In the wake of the Jihad and Devlin Stone''s creation of the Republic of the Sphere,
  the ancient Order of ComStar was transformed. Their once-proud Com Guards were disbanded,
  never to rise again. Gone were the robes, the religion, the chants--and the Word
  of Blake. But deep within the shattered Order remained a secret outlasting the long
  decades of peace: the Com Guard reborn...and with it, hidden believers in the old
  ways of ComStar.<p>_x000D_

  _x000D_

  In 3135, the secret of the Com Guard and their Blessed Order got out. With the Inner
  Sphere torn apart by the HPG Blackout, the reformed Com Guard found itself in an
  epic battle against the Republic of the Sphere, their very survival at stake.<p>_x000D_

  <b>Turning Points: Epsilon Eridani</b> uses Chaos Campaign rules and gives players
  the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it
  into their own campaigns and even creating their own scenarios with optional rules
  to give their games an Epsilon flavor. The PDF exclusive includes a detailed map
  of the world of Epsilon Eridani, a rundown of the forces involved in the conflict,
  and several tracks that players can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles or
  stage a planetary invasion. Only the players'' imaginations are the limits._x000D_
