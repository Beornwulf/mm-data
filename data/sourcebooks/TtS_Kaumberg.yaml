description: 'Nestled in the wide frontiers of Lyran space, Kaumberg is a pastoral
  world known mostly for its woodlands and little else. But just below the mundane
  surface lies a world of political intrigue, its fortunes and falls tied inextricably
  to those of the Commonwealth to whom its rulers serve. Collective masters of one
  of the region’s strongest independent defense forces, the barons of Kaumberg stand
  ever-ready to protect their world and its neighbors from any Periphery threat that
  comes their way—but only as long as their own internal intrigues don’t get in the
  way.<p><p>_x000D_
