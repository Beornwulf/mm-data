description: '<p><strong>Wings of the Eagle!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wracked for
  centuries by civil wars, House Marik''s Free Worlds League has endured by virtue
  of the tenacity and diversity of its people. Now, led by the strongest Captain-General
  in half a millennium, House Marik has stretched its wings, pushing the shadows of
  its influence across the Inner Sphere. Both by its revitalized military and an economic
  might that challenges even the ages-old dominance of House Steiner, the eagle soars
  proudly, as do the people who wave its banner.</p><p>The Second in a new, dynamic
  Classic BattleTech series, <strong>Handbook: House Marik</strong> compiles the crucial
  history, politics and cultures of the Inner Sphere''s first Great House. More than
  just a sourcebook, <i>Handbook: House Marik</i> includes rules for both <i>BattleTech</i>
  and <i>Classic BattleTech RPG</i> campaigns, including new support vehicles, creatures,
  personal weapons, life paths and more!</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/handbook-house-marik">Buy
