description: '<p>November 3067 saw the culmination of work two centuries in the making,
  work begun by Primus Conrad Toyama of ComStar, successor to Jerome Blake and the
  man responsible for single-handedly turning ComStar into a pseudo-religious organization
  with a vision: to lead mankind to the light.<br><br>But then the Second Star League
  collapsed.<br><br>Denied their dream, the Blakists fought to preserve the Star League
  against the follies of the Great Houses, its fanaticism manifested as the Jihad:
  a horrific war that pitted every nation against each other. This era saw bleeding
  edge machines march off to war, while venerable ‘Mechs continued to receive upgrades
  and facelifts. Even primitive ‘Mechs not seen in over half a millennia once again
  appear on the battlefield.<br><br>BattleTech Record Sheets: Jihad offers players
  the record sheets for all the ‘Mechs detailed in BattleTech Technical Readout: Jihad,
  281 in total.<br><br>Note: These are selections from several other products. The
  selected entries in this PDF are reprinted—albeit with the current BattleTech logo—from
