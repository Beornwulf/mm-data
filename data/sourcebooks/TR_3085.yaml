description: '<p>In December 3076, Devlin Stone marshaled the nations of the Inner
  Sphere and began Operation SCOUR. The two-year final push to Terra was the bloodiest
  fighting seen in centuries. In the end, Terra had been freed with the Word of Blake
  scattered to the darkest corners of the universe. Stepping into that vacuum, Stone
  forged a new "Terran Hegemony" in The Republic of the Sphere. With the end of the
  Jihad, the survivors are rebuilding their shattered armies, introducing new machines
  to replace those whose factories ceased to exist in the fires of the Jihad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BattleTech
  Technical Readout: 3085</strong> gives a detailed look at the machines introduced
  during the waning days of the Jihad and into the founding days of Devlin Stone''s
  Republic of the Sphere. This book includes the latest ''Mechs, battle armor, aerospace
  and vehicles as well as new late-Jihad support vehicles. In addition, this sourcebook
  heralds the long-awaited update of <i>Technical Readout: Project Phoenix</i>, featuring
  brand-new art and additional variants. Conventional infantry make their Technical
  Readout debut with fifty-six individual infantry formations from classic foot infantry
  to xeno-planetary soldiers. And finally, after more than twenty years of silence,
  Land-Air BattleMechs explode back into a Technical Readout with a look at the original
  four LAMs and their Star League history.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-technical-readout-3085-pdf">Buy
