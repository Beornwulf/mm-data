description: '<p>The wait is over as the Federated Commonwealth hammer falls upon
  the Draconis Combine. The War of 3039’s Commonwealth Thrust focuses on Vega, a world
  of burning sands, blazing sun, and the ruins of ancient Star League technology.
  A combined force of Steiner, Davion, and mercenary units showcases the massive alliance
  and technology of the Federated Commonwealth. The Combine defense, led by the Legions
  of Vega, is determined to justify the reforms and faith of the Coordinator. They
  will not surrender their homeworld easily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Turning Points:
  Vega (3039)</strong> uses <i>Chaos Campaign</i> rules to give players the option
  of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, or inserting the heated
  battle for Vega into their own campaigns. Included are a detailed map of the world
  of Vega, full details of the forces involved in the conflict, and scenario tracks
  recreating the battles on Vega. The only limits are the players’ imaginations!</p><p><br><a
