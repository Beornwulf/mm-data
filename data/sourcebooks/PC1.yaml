  In the mid-25th century, factions of mankind are desperate to invent the next technological
  leap in warfare—a machine that would give each group an overwhelming advantage on
  the battlefield. And no one is more aware of the race to perfect this new machine
  than the leaders on Terra.<p>_x000D_

  But during the final trials to find the first pilot for the Terran prototype, the
  contest is infiltrated by a deadly enemy who wants to ensure that no one survives.
  It''s up to the last remaining Terran candidate—and a scientist struggling to make
  a breakthrough on the human-machine interface that will control this new war machine—to
  save Terra''s BattleMech program from those who wish to destroy it._x000D_
