description: '<p><strong>Tearing Down the Walls!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For more
  than ten years, the Word of Blake''s Jihad has engulfed the states of the Inner
  Sphere and the invading Clans in chaos and fire. Reeling from attacks on all fronts,
  realms have fought one another while the Word''s masters built a powerful Protectorate
  around humanity''s home: Terra. But with the rise of a resourceful rebel leader,
  Devlin Stone, the collective might of the Great Houses and rival Clans have united
  for an all-out assault against the Protectorate--one that can only end when humanity''s
  home is free once again!</p><p><strong>Jihad Hot Spots: Terra</strong> continues
  the Jihad plot book series started with Blake Ascending, bringing readers into the
  latter years of the war between the Word of Blake and the Inner Sphere. Seen from
  the eyes of those who fight and die in this epic struggle, this book includes articles
  and intelligence excerpts from across the Inner Sphere, along with additional rules
  and campaign tracks for both BattleTech campaigns played using the <i>Total Warfare</i>
  and <i>A Time of War</i> game rules. This book also provides a rare, in-depth look
  at the Terran system itself, including the history and varied cultures who live
  on these most revered worlds. Also included are rules and units for the elaborate
  defense network the Word of Blake unveiled against Stone and his allied Coalition
  throughout the Protectorate campaign.</p><p><br><a href="http://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-jihad-hot-spots-terra-pdf">Buy
