description: '<p>In 3049, the first Clan forces appeared in the Inner Sphere. Armed
  with advanced technologies of a long-dead age, the warlike invaders unleashed a
  devastating blitzkrieg, capturing world after world until a Clan victory seemed
  certain. Unable to match the enemy''s superior ''Mechs, the Inner Sphere militaries
  increasingly turned to their combat fleets for relief, only to find the skies filled
  with deadly Clan DropShips, JumpShips, and WarShips, massive vessels not seen in
  the Inner Sphere for hundreds of years. Now the Great Houses have begun to rebuild
  their own armadas and stand ready to challenge the Clan invasers in the infinite
  battlefield of space.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This revised edition of the original Technical
  Readout: 3057 contains descriptions, illustrations, and full AeroTech 2 statistics
  for the latest Inner Sphere and Clan DropsShips, JumpShips, WarShips, small craft,
  and space stations common in 3057. Additionally, this volume contains twenty-four
  WarShips mentioned in the fictional context of the BattleTech universe but never
  before presented in a technical readout.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-technical-readout-3057-revised-edition-pdf">Buy
