description: 'On the pirate haven of Tortuga Prime, alliances can shift and power
  can exchange hands at a moment’s notice. An interstellar kleptocracy, Tortuga Prime’s
  only rule is simple: take what you need, and try to keep it. Will you further the
  centuries-old cycle of needless death and destruction—or put a stop to it once and
  for all?<p><p>_x000D_
