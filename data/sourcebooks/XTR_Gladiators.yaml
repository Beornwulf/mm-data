description: '<p><strong>Let the Games Continue!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Solaris
  VII, Noisiel, Westerhand, Astrokaszy--these are just a few of the so-called Game
  Worlds of the Inner Sphere. As the Word of Blake''s shadow of terror recedes from
  the worlds where warriors did battle for the little more than entertainment and
  profit, the arenas have once more come to life with the cheers of spectators and
  the clash of high-tech gladiators. Yet even as these modern champions wage wars
  in the controlled chaos of the dueling circuit, new technologies continue to advance.
  Eager stables and warriors employ the latest in prototype designs, seeking any edge
  they can find against their competitors.</p><p><strong>Experimental Tech Readout:
  Gladiators</strong> samples the custom designs that have appeared in the arenas
  of the BattleTech universe during the Jihad. Each design featured in this book incorporates
  some of the latest technologies developed by the realms of the Inner Sphere as the
  war against the Word of Blake continues. These technologies--first described in
  <i>Tactical Operations</i>--now face their live-fire trials in the arenas of the
  various Game Worlds. Statistics and Record Sheets are included for 13 new experimental
  BattleMechs, vehicles, and battle armor units, ready for play in advanced <i>BattleTech</i>
  games.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-experimental-technical-readout-gladiators-pdf">Buy
