  Terra is secure. The Protectorate is free. The Manei Domini are scattered. The Master
  has fled to his final refuge. As the last embers of the Word of Blake are finally
  extinguished across the Inner Sphere, a new nation is born--and a new era is dawning.
  Forged in the fires of the greatest war fought since the coming of the Clans, the
  Republic of the Sphere promises peace and stability few could have imagined since
  the start of the Jihad in 3067.<p>_x000D_

  <b>Jihad: Final Reckoning</b> completes the Jihad plot book series started with
  Blake Ascending, wrapping up the final years of the war between the Word of Blake
  and the Inner Sphere, and establishing the birth of the Republic of the Sphere.
  With articles covering the final fateful years of the war, this book includes articles
  and intelligence reports from across the Inner Sphere, along with additional rules
  and campaign tracks for BattleTech campaigns played using the <i>Total Warfare</i>
  and <i>A Time of War game rules</i>. This book also provides a snapshot of the postwar
  universe, laying the groundwork for future campaigns. Also included is a glimpse
  at the more fantastic weapons and assets the Word of Blake was developing before
  its final fall--complete with rules for top-secret units, including the Caspar III
  system and Spectral LAMs._x000D_
