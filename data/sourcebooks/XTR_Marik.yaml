description: '<p><strong>Marik Resourcefulness</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Shattered
  the Jihad and left in ruins, House Marik''s Free Worlds League has crumbled in the
  face of betrayal and deceit. Parliament is scattered, and alliances spanning generations
  have been broken. But even in death the dream of the Free Worlds lingers, and the
  economic and industrial might that once stood poised to usurp the powerhouse of
  House Steiner''s Lyran Alliance still churns out cutting-edge technologies for a
  new interstellar order. In factories and test sites deep within the borders of the
  sundered League, powerful new secret weapons, devised during the darkest days of
  the war against the Word of Blake, are making their debut to defend the shadow of
  their fallen motherlands.</p><p><strong>Experimental Technical Readout: Marik</strong>
  samples the custom and prototype designs that have begun to turn up in testing labs
  and top-secret proving grounds of the crumbling Free Worlds League. Each design
  featured in this book incorporates some of the latest technologies developed by
  the realms of the Inner Sphere as the war against the Word of Blake winds toward
  its final conclusion. These technologies--first described in <i>Tactical Operations</i>--have
  yet to achieve widespread production, but each has been prototyped and rushed to
  the field for their desperate consumers. Statistics and Record Sheets are included
  for 13 new experimental BattleMechs, vehicles, aerospace units, and battle armor
  designs presented in this book, ready for play in advanced <i>BattleTech</i> games.</p><p><br><a
