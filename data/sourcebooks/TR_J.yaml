description: '<p>November 3067 saw the culmination of work two centuries in the making,
  work begun by Primus Conrad Toyama of ComStar, successor to Jerome Blake and the
  man responsible for single-handedly turning ComStar into a pseudo-religious organization
  with a vision: to lead mankind to the light.</p><p>But then the Second Star League
  collapsed .</p><p>Denied their dream, the Blakists fought to preserve the Star League
  against the follies of the Great Houses, its fanaticism manifested as the Jihad:
  a horrific war that pitted every nation against each other. This era saw bleeding
  edge machines march off to war, while venerable ’Mechs continued to receive upgrades
  and facelifts. Even primitive ’Mechs not seen in over half a millennia once again
  appear on the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Technical Readout: Jihad</strong> expands
  on <i>Technical Readout: Succession Wars</i> and <i>Technical Readout: Clan Invasion</i>
  by combining the ’Mechs previously found in <i>Technical Readout: 3050 Upgrade</i>
  , <i>Technical Readout: 3055 Upgrade</i> , <i>Technical Readout: 3058 Upgrade</i>
  , <i>Technical Readout: 3060</i> , <i>Technical Readout: 3067</i> , <i>Technical
  Readout: 3075</i> , <i>Technical Readout: 3085</i> , and <i>Technical Readout: Project
  Phoenix</i> , this volume features some of the most common ’Mechs from the Jihad.
  Each machine is accompanied by an illustration, a description of its history, capabilities,
  and game stats.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-technical-readout-jihad">Buy
