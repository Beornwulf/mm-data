description: '<p><strong>One Species, One Realm</strong></p><p>In 2570, the six Great
  Houses of the Inner Sphere united to create the Star League, promising to bring
  an end to the generations of warfare that engulfed the worlds mankind now called
  home. Shortly thereafter, to seal their alliance, they turned against the various
  independent realms of the Periphery. Over the next twenty years, the so-called Reunification
  War would rage, claiming more lives than the savagery of the Age of War before it,
  all to realize House Cameron''s dream of a united humanity--at any cost.</p><p><strong>Historical:
  Reunification War</strong> describes the first grand military campaign of the newborn
  Star League against the collected realms of the Periphery. Covering each of the
  four major campaign theaters in detail, this book provides a hard look at the formative
  years of the first Star League, and the fateful decisions that led them to usher
  in a new Golden Age for mankind by unleashing their armies against its most far-flung
  worlds.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-historical-reunification-war-pdf">Buy
