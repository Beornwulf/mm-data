description: '<p>From the star-spanning devastation of the Word of Blake Jihad arose
  the Republic of the Sphere, a new nation dedicated to breaking the centuries-long
  cycle of warfare plaguing the Inner Sphere and creating new innovation and prosperity
  for all.<br>The ideals of the Republic worked—for a time.<br><br>Then in 3132, hyperpulse
  generators across thousands of worlds went offline, enveloping the Inner Sphere
  in silence. Paranoia and opportunism ran rampant as age-old hostilities reignited
  and chaos ruled the day. The Republic, the grand experiment in hope, was torn asunder
  by hostile forces on every side.<br><br>The Republic Era—better known as the Dark
  Age—was a time of upheaval and opportunity. Fortunes rose and fell, nations crumbled
  and others reconstituted. And at the center of the whirlwind lay Terra, the crown
  jewel of the Republic, a prize waiting for the warrior strong enough to seize it.<br><br>BattleTech
