  _x000D_

  Heroes, patriots, soldiers, freedom fighters. The universe is full of them, and
  every realm and military force--from the mightiest Successor State to the humblest
  mercenary band--has its share. In the newborn Republic of the Sphere, Ilyana Lamenkov
  and her lance of fresh young MechWarriors must earn their stripes on the war-torn
  world of Schedar. Do these green recruits have what it takes to become heroes of
  the Republic, or will they fail their realm and simply vanish into obscurity?<p>_x000D_

  _x000D_

  Lamenkov''s Liability describes a lance of notable MechWarriors from the nascent
  Republic of the Sphere, highlighting their warriors, their machines, and their abilities
  both on and off the battlefields of the late 31st century. This Lance Pack dossier
  file provides players with the background and descriptions of all four members of
  the Liability lance and a micro-campaign based on their exploits, complete with
  character and BattleMech record sheets suitable for play with <i>Total Warfare</i>
  and <i>A Time of War: The BattleTech Roleplaying Game</i>.<p>_x000D_
