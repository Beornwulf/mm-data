description: '<p>The year is 3120. Under the aegis of the Republic of the Sphere,
  the Inner Sphere has experienced its greatest time of peace since the days of the
  original Star League. Raised from the ashes of the Jihad, the Republic stands for
  the ideals of unity and justice, but even its triumphs have come at no small cost
  in blood. Entering the thirty-second century with a mixture of righteousness and
  hubris, the Republic remains at the forefront of a new arms race. Technologies considered
  experimental not so very long ago are now being fielded by line regiments as factories
  have retooled accordingly. For friend and foe alike, the Republic''s technological
  standards are definitive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Experimental Technical Readout:
  Republic</strong> samples production and custom machines that have appeared in the
  BattleTech universe by the early decades of the thirty-second century. Each unit
  featured in this book incorporates some of the new technologies that debuted in
  Tactical Operations - now employed by the armed forces of the Republic of the Sphere
  and its contemporaries. Statistics and Record Sheets are included for 13 new advanced
  and experimental BattleMechs, vehicles, and aerospace and battle armor units, ready
  for play in <i>BattleTech</i> games up to the year 3120.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-experimental-technical-readout-republic-volume-i-p">Buy
