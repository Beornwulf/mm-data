description: '<p>KING OF THE BATTLEFIELD</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On February 5, 2439, the
  Mackie obliterated all opposition during its first combat trial, ushering in a new
  era of warfare. The BattleMech—King of the Battlefield—was born. BattleMechs reached
  their pinnacle during the golden age of the Star League. The fall of the Star League
  and the Succession Wars that raged for centuries afterward took their toll and by
  the Fourth Succession War, the technology employed on the battlefields was a mere
  shadow of what it once was. However, the discovery of the Helm Memory Core unlocked
  the technological potential to develop new BattleMechs and experimental technologies
  for the first time in centuries.</p><p>Technical Readout: Succession Wars is the
  perfect “first Technical Readout” companion to the BattleMech Manual. Combining
  the ’Mechs previously found in Technical Readout: 3039, Technical Readout: 3050
  Upgrade, Technical Readout: 3058 Upgrade, and Technical Readout: 3075, this volume
  features some of the most common ’Mechs from the Age of War to the Succession Wars.
  Each machine is illustrated in detail, and accompanied by a description of its history,
  capabilities, game stats, along with their most famous pilots.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>Note:

  Readout: 3039, Technical Readout: 3050 Upgrade, Technical Readout: 3058 Upgrade,
