description: '<p><strong>MIGHT OF THE DRAGON</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of all the
  armies of the Inner Sphere, none is as universally feared and respected as that
  of House Kurita''s Draconis Combine. With fighting skills learned in the finest
  academies and tempered by the ancient code of Bushido, the MechWarriors of the DCMS
  know no equals. Their loyalty and skill are legendary, and their tenacity has won
  them hundreds of battles across known space. This classified Field Manual, seized
  from the Combine''s Internal Security Force, reveals the inner workings of the Draconis
  Combine Military, from District Regular units to the elite Sword of Light regiments.
  This document is an invaluable resource for both allies and enemies of the Combine.</p><p><strong>BattleTech
  Field Manual: Draconis Combine</strong> contains extensive information about all
  aspects of House Kurita''s Military. Every BattleMech Regiment of the DCMS is described
  in detail, including their history, officers and tactics. Special rules reflecting
  the unique abilities of each regiment are included as an optional expansion to BattleTech
  play. Among the many other features of the book are new weapons, equipment, and
  BattleMechs unique to the Draconis Combine.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-field-manual-capellan-confederation-pdf">Buy
