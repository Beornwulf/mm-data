  _x000D_

  In late 3067, the Word of Blake unleashed its Jihad, fanning the flames of violence
  and spreading it across the Inner Sphere. Three mercenary commands struggled to
  find their footing and profit from the all-encompassing warfare. As they navigated
  their way through the conflicts erupting on hundreds of worlds, these mercenaries
  grew in power, prestige, and character. Facing adversity, victory, defeat, and enemies
  within and without, they were typical of many commands touched for ill or for good
  by the Jihad.<p>_x000D_

  As the Jihad unfolded through the Jihad Hot Spots plotbooks, players were introduced
  to the Chaos Campaign, a new game play system that gave players the opportunity
  to craft their own games around specific battles and events of the Jihad. Now that
  campaign, spanning fourteen years of conflict, has been collected and updated. Presented
  here are all of the Chaos Campaign tracks from the Hot Spots plotbooks and interwoven
  with select tracks from the <i>Jihad Turning Points</i> e-publication series and
  several all-new tracks and mini-campaigns.<p>_x000D_

  This volume also includes detailed reports on nearly forty planetary campaigns,
  providing context and details previously clouded by interstellar media, local reports,
  and personal journals. With an updated and streamlined core ruleset for the Chaos
  Campaign and new Jihad era Random Availability Tables for the Word of Blake, Mercenaries,
  and Militias, this book has everything players and gamemasters need to recreate
  the pivotal campaigns of the Jihad and lead their forces to victory._x000D_
