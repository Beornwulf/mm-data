description: '<p>The year is 3026 and war has ravaged the thousands of worlds of the
  Inner Sphere for centuries. Successor Lords send clashing armies to conquer neighbors
  and re-establish the long-lost Star League. Though the BattleMech is the king of
  the battlefield, it is supported by a much vaster array of conventional vehicles
  that fight every where from premier border worlds to the back waters of beyond.
  When in the hands of an experienced field commander, even a BattleMech must be leery
  when facing a company of tanks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This revised edition of the original
  Technical Readout: 3026 features the most common military vehicles of the Succession
  Wars. Additionally, this volume contains nineteen vehicles, aerospace fighters,
  DropShips and JumpShips mentioned in the fictional context of the BattleTech universe
  but never before presented in a technical readout.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-technical-readout-3039-pdf">Buy
