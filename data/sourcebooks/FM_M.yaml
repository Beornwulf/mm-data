  to do and who to kill, and hanging your butt out on the line every day just so some

  can measure up in the big leagues, and carve your name into the history books for
  all time? Well, bud, now it''s time to put up or shut up, because not everyone is
  cut out for the rough and tumble life of today''s mercenary! War''s a dangerous
  business, and for the professional soldier, survival ain''t as simple as coming
  out of the firefight alive!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Classic BattleTech Field
