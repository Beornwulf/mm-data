  <p><b>Shrapnel: The Official BattleTech Magazine</b> celebrates bravery in all its
  forms on the triumphant, BattleMech-dominated battlefields of 31st century and beyond!
  Witness the birth of a new mercenary command in the late Third Succession War, follow
  a combat medic tackling a precarious injury, learn the true meaning of loyalty during
  the FedCom Civil War, and track down pirates on a forgotten world in the Periphery.
  Then don your neurohelmet and push back against the enemy with technical readouts,
  ghost ship sightings, in-depth technology articles, unit digests, playable scenarios,
  and more—all from BattleTech veterans and a squad of new authors:_x000D_
