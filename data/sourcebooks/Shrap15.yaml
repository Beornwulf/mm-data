description: '<h2>ALWAYS READ THE FINE PRINT</h2><p><i>Shrapnel: The Official BattleTech
  Magazine</i> is your go-to source for brutal, heavy-metal BattleMech action across
  the battlefields of the 31st century and beyond—and now it’s bigger than ever before!
  This special double-size issue is jam-packed with the true currency of the Inner
  Sphere: mercenary troops!</p><p>To reclaim a priceless personal memento, the Gray
  Death Legion must teach a young noble an invaluable lesson. The Northwind Highlanders,
  facing the loss of everything they hold dear, must defend their homeworld by forcing
  House Davion to pay in blood for every centimeter they gain. When the Crescent Hawks
  discover a lost family member might still be alive, they will stop at nothing to
  find her and bring her home.</p><p>In this issue, you’ll search for the fabled city
  of gold in the former Rim Worlds Republic, witness the Kell Hounds interview a new
  recruit with an unusual connection to Morgan Kell himself, and learn the trials
  and tribulations of a novice mercenary on a long-haul space journey for the first
  time. Experience the true cost of losing a personal ’Mech in battle, evade competing
  mercenary units fighting over your secret cargo, and raid a lost vault for invaluable
  treasure on behalf of a prestigious collector.</p><p>Whatever the job, there’s always
  soldiers of fortune ready to sign on the dotted line, and they can build their legend
  with content such as advice articles on how to run a mercenary unit and negotiate
  favorable contracts; Unit and Planet Digests for intel on the competition; technical
  readouts on unique ’Mechs; various downtime entertainment options; playable scenarios
  to test your tactical chops; and much more—all by veteran <i>BattleTech</i> authors
  and a new addition to the roster:</p><p>Michael A. Stackpole | Bryan Young | Chris
