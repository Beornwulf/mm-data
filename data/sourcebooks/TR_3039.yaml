description: '<p>In 2781 the Star League was officially abandoned, ending a two-hundred-year-long
  Golden Age. The Successor Lords launched a series of massive conflicts in 2785 that
  would rage for centuries and become known as the Succession Wars. Such endless warfare
  took its toll, and by the Fourth Succession War of 3028 the technology employed
  on the battlefields was a mere shadow of the height of the Star League. However,
  the discovery of the Helm Memory Core started to unlock such sought-after secrets,
  with new BattleMechs and experimental technologies emerging for the first time in
  centuries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Classic BattleTech Technical Readout: 3039</strong>
  is the perfect ''first Technical Readout'' companion to the <i>Classic BattleTech
  Introductory Box Set </i>. Combining the ''Mechs, vehicles and aerospace fighters
  previously found in <i>Technical Readout: 3025, Revised </i>and <i>Technical Readout:
  3026, Revised</i>, this volume features some of the most common units of the Succession
  Wars. Each machine is illustrated in detail, accompanied by a description of its
  history, capabilities, game stats, along with their most famous pilots.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br><a
