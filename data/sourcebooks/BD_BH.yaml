  Heroes, patriots, soldiers, freedom fighters. The universe is full of them, and
  every realm and military force--from the mightiest Successor State to the humblest
  mercenary band--has its share. Feared across the Inner Sphere, the enigmatic Bounty
  Hunter and his lance of MechWarriors prowl the battlefields of the universe for
  the most dangerous of prey. Their deadly calling has carried on for generations,
  and even the dawning years of the Jihad were no exception.<p>_x000D_

  The Bounty Hunter Lance describes the notable MechWarriors who served alongside
  the Bounty Hunter during the early Jihad era, highlighting the abilities of these
  warriors and their machines, both on and off the battlefields of the 31st century.
  This Lance Pack dossier file provides players with the background and descriptions
  of all four members of the Hunter''s lance and a micro-campaign based on their Jihad
  exploits, complete with character and BattleMech record sheets suitable for play
  with <i>Total Warfare</i> and <i>A Time of War: The BattleTech Roleplaying Game</i>._x000D_
