description: 'For MechWarrior Zane, allegiance to the Nova Cat Clan comes above all
  else. So when he sees his clan disgraced, cast out, and suddenly allied with the
  hated Inner Sphere, Zane''s only desire is to see the Nova Cats returned to their
  former greatness.<p><p>_x000D_

  For Palmer Yoshio, the Draconis Combine is the only honorable thing in a chaotic
  galaxy. But when he is forced to train alongside the outcast Nova Cats, he finds
  that his own notion of honor is a far cry from his leader''s.<p>_x000D_

  _x000D_

  of the fallen comrades--and neither warrior will be able to look at their universe
  in the same way again..._x000D_
