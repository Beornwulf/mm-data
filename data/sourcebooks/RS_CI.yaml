description: '<p>On 27 September 3048, the ComStar Explorer Corps JumpShip Outbound
  Light stumbled onto the Clan Homeworlds, setting in motion a massive invasion of
  the Inner Sphere by the Clans. At first sweeping all before them with their advanced
  technologies, the Clans met defeat at the Battle of Tukayyid and were stymied by
  a 15-year truce. With the clock ticking, the Inner Sphere’s elite took the battle
  directly to the Clan Homeworlds. There, the destruction of Clan Smoke Jaguar and
  the defeat of the Clans in the Great Refusal ended the invasion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BattleTech
