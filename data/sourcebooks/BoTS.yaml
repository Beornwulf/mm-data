  <p>The Battle of Tukayyid campaign book brings the pivotal conflict of the Clan
  Invasion to life in stunning grandeur. But the Tukayyid experience is too exciting
  to be contained in a single volume, and this Supplemental expands upon the options
  within that book._x000D_

  _x000D_

  <p>Two sections dig further into BattleTech lore, allowing players to use the full
  range of mapsheets and record sheets published to date, while a Battlefield Support:
  Combined Arms Worksheet makes those rules easier to use._x000D_

  _x000D_

  <p>Additionally, over two hundred record sheets cover every â€™Mech included in the
  Battle of Tukayyid campaign book. Finally, a Strategic BattleForce expansion includes
  the rules, maps, and Formation Record Sheets to use the rules in Interstellar Operations
  to play out the Battle of Tukayyid with large-scale games._x000D_
