description: '<p>Devlin Stone''s Military Material Redemption Program transformed
  the Inner Sphere, retooling BattleMech production lines for civilian output and
  boosting state economies. Companies that had made their names building machines
  of destruction now found themselves turning more towards peaceful IndustrialMech
  manufacture. Downsized and heavily regulated by Stone''s policies, Irian Technologies
  was an exemplary model of the Republic''s new paradigm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But IrTech
  has kept a secret through the long decades of peace: a fully functional Marauder
  II production line hidden away from the Republic''s auditors and enforcers. In late
  3133, however, that secret got out. With the Republic already torn by factional
  strife, the revelation of IrTech''s deception has everyone scrambling to win the
  prize. Who will emerge victorious from this all-out faction war?</p><p><strong>Dark
  Age Turning Points: Irian</strong> uses Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the
  option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into
  their own campaigns and even creating their own scenarios with optional rules to
  give their games an Irian flavor. The ebook includes a detailed map of the world
  of Irian, a run down of the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks
  that players can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage up to a world-wide
  invasion. Only the players'' imaginations are the limits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br><a
