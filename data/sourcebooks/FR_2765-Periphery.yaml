description: '<p><strong>Gathering Forces...</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2765,
  the Star League Defense Force was the greatest military ever assembled, unparalleled
  in numbers and technological prowess--but it was not alone. The House Lords and
  the rulers of the Territorial States in the Periphery each amassed armies of their
  own. While none of these powers alone could challenge the sheer size and might of
  the SLDF, each stood ready to defend their own interests against the avarice of
  their neighbors.</p><p><strong>Field Report 2765: Periphery</strong> describes the
  state of the four great Periphery States just before the events described in <i>Historical:
  Liberation of Terra Vol 1</i>, including the overall military and logistical condition
  of the fringe powers--including the infamous Rim Worlds Republic, whose House Amaris
  would bring about the collapse of the Star League that would eventually plunge the
  rest of the Inner Sphere into a new age of endless war.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-field-report-2765-periphery-pdf">Buy
