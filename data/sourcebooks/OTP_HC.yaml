description: '<p>Tensions simmered between the Hanseatic League and the new Scorpion
  Empire for decades before the Hansa lit the spark that led to war. The Khan of Clan
  Goliath Scorpion knew a simple punitive expedition would be a waste of resources.
  This would not be a war of reprisal. It would be an all-out crusade for control
  of Hansa territory. Superior Clan technology pitted against superior numbers of
  Hansa troops. In such a war, can there truly be a victor? Would two nations be shattered
  in the conflict, or would a single, new power rise from the ruins?_x000D_
