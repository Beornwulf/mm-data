description: 'On October 25, 3068, the Word of Blake flooded the Inner Sphere HPG
  networks with "White Noise", a stream of gibberish and propaganda that made normal
  communications virtually impossible. Amid the noise, stunning secrets were revealed:
  Anastasius Focht was once Frederick Steiner; ComStar Primus Sharilar Mori was a
  Kurita spy.<p><p>_x000D_

  Yet along with the secrets revealed and the spreading fires of the Jihad, the Blakists
  unveiled terrible new weapons and an army the size of which the intelligence agencies
  of the Inner Sphere had scarcely dreamed, spawning a darker, new wave of mysteries,
  and whispers of shadowy cabals. Hidden worlds, cults of assassins, ancient societies
  and even the mysteries of hyperspace--all emerged as possible sources for the Word
  of Blake''s newfound power. Once more spanning all of human space from ancient Terra
  to the far-flung Clan homeworlds, the conspiracies behind the Jihad could be the
  key to unraveling the greatest war since the days of Amaris.<p>_x000D_

  <b>Jihad Conspiracies: Interstellar Players 2</b> describes several of the most
  powerful and influential people, organizations, and entities at work behind the
  scenes of the Word of Blake Jihad. Some of these conspiracies are firmly grounded
  in Classic BattleTech lore, but shown here in ways never before seen; others have
  only recently emerged from their own shadows. Gamemasters and players can decide
  which of these power brokers are real and which are paranoid fantasies spawned by
  the chaos and fear of the Blakist Holy War!_x000D_
