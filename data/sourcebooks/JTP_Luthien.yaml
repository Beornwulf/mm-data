description: '<p><strong>THE BLACK PEARL UNDER SIEGE</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Luthien.
  The Black Pearl. Jewel of the Dragon. The center of the Draconis Combine, Luthien
  had never been conquered by an enemy in over four centuries.</p><p>Then came the
  Jihad.</p><p><strong>Jihad Turning Points: Luthien</strong> fleshes out the details
  of the conflict surrounding this pivotal world published in various Jihad Plot Sourcebooks.
  Additionally, players can join one of the myriad of units fighting for control--and
  survival--of the Combine''s capital world. Enemies from within and without seek
  to cut off the Dragon''s head, while loyal samurai fight to save it.</p><p>This
  new campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of
  fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into their own
  campaigns and even create their own scenarios with optional rules to give their
  games a ''Luthien flavor.'' The ebook includes a detailed map of the world of Luthien,
  a run down of the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks that players
  can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage up to a world-wide invasion.
  Only the players'' imaginations are the limits.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/01-battletech-jihad-turning-points-luthien-pdf-exclusive">Buy
