description: '<p><strong>Sword of Damocles</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dominant for
  centuries, House Davion has led the Federated Suns to greatness through brilliant
  and innovative leadership. The Federated Suns have carved a prominent swath through
  history: the Davions formed a military that rewrote modern warfare; created the
  New Avalon Institute of Science, giving the Inner Sphere its first technological
  renaissance in three centuries; and united the military might of the Federated Suns
  with the economic power of House Steiner, creating the vast star empire known as
  the Federated Commonwealth. But with such power comes corruption - and civil war
  is looming on the horizon.</p><p><strong>BattleTech Field Manual: Federated Suns</strong>
  provides profiles on every Federated Suns regiment, including their loyalties, and
  provides special rules, new equipment and ''Mechs unique to this powerful House.</p><p><br><a
