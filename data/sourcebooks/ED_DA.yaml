description: '<p><strong>GRAY MONDAY</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 August 3132. On
  that day, eighty percent of the hyperpulse generators throughout the Inner Sphere
  fell silent and humanity''s communications link across the stars was severed. While
  many looked to the Republic of the Sphere for guidance through the darkness, others
  used the crisis to advance their own agendas and political ideologies. As a new
  era began, old hatreds and rivalries, long suppressed in the optimism of Stone''s
  Peace, threatened to overwhelm all that had been achieved in the new century.</p><p>A
  Dark Age had fallen, one that would see the death of empires and the rise of tyrants.
  And the seeds of destruction would be planted in these first days after the Blackout.</p><p><strong>Era
  Digest: Dark Age</strong> is a mini-sourcebook that explores the pivotal developments
