description: 'In 3007, Cranston Snord''s Irregulars emerged from the winnings of a
  poker game. Under the command of Cranston Snord, an officer disgraced and discharged
  from Wolf''s Dragoons, the Irregulars gained a reputation for unorthodox tactics
  and a fetish for collecting lost artifacts and treasures. Now, 43 years later, Cranston
  has given his daughter Rhonda active command of the Irregulars. Under her leadership,
  the Irregulars have grown in size and reputation.<p><p>_x000D_

  The Federated Commonwealth command used the Irregulars against House Marik with
  satisfying results, and they looked the other way when the Irregulars went collecting.
  Now, the battered Federated Commonwealth wants the Irregulars to conduct raids into
  Clan-held territory. The Irregulars are willing to take on the Clans, but they have
  another objective in mind; a Star League naval base believed to be deep inside Clan-held
  territory.<p>_x000D_
