description: '<p><strong>The End Times</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2777--after
  ten years of savage fighting in the Periphery--General Aleksandr Kerensky and the
  Star League Defense Force launched the final phase in the war against Stefan Amaris,
  the Usurper of the Star League. For two more years, the greatest army ever forged
  by humankind would wage a planet-by-planet war for the heart of the League itself,
  ultimately landing on mankind''s homeworld of Terra. As the single greatest campaign
  ever fought in human history, Operation LIBERATION would change the fate of generations
  to come.</p><p><strong>Historical: Liberation of Terra, Volume 2</strong> describes
  the final years of the civil war that ultimately brought about the end of the first
  Star League. Covering the fighting that followed Kerensky''s conquest of the Rim
  Worlds Republic and the early stages of the Hegemony campaign to the final conclusive
  battles on Terra itself, this book provides a hard look at the last days of the
  Star League Era, and the fateful decisions that would eventually pave the way for
  centuries of Succession Wars to come.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-historical-liberation-of-terra-vol-2-pdf">Buy
