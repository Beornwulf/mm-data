description: '<p>Never really considered a major blip in the newly-created Second
  Star Leagues'' plan, Luzerne--through simple chance--became listed in the history
  books as one of the longest and desperate campaigns during Operation BULLDOG. The
  former Combine system became the defining moment for Clan Smoke Jaguar on the eve
  of their demise. Battered and beaten, the Clan fought tooth and nail to hold on
  to Luzerne even as the remains of their Occupation Zone fell in tatters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Historical
  Turning Points: Luzerne</strong> looks at the pivotal battle that defined the Second
  Star League''s Operation BULLDOG and spelled the end of the most vicious Clans occupying
  the Inner Sphere. Return to BattleTech''s recent past, when the Inner Sphere''s
  newly-united realms embarked on their own crusade to rid themselves of Clan Smoke
  Jaguar.</p><p>This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players
  the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, or inserting
  it into their own campaigns. This PDF exclusive includes a detailed map of the planet
  of Luzerne, a rundown of the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks

  are the limits.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-historical-turning-points-luzerne-pdf">Buy
