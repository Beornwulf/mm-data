description: '<p>After the fall of the first Star League and the exodus of the SLDF,
  the five Great Houses of the Inner Sphere unleashed their armies against one another
  with a vengeance, each claiming to be the rightful heirs to the Cameron legacy and
  the First Lordship of the Inner Sphere. Their scorched earth tactics left entire
  worlds barren, and destroyed many of the precious technologies taken for granted
  during the golden days of the Star League''s peak. As the years stretched into centuries,
  their great navies evaporated, and even their mighty BattleMech armies shrank and
  regressed as their advanced weapons and equipment failed and were forgotten.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yet
  even as the Inner Sphere slid toward scavenger tech, the various powers of the Inner
  Sphere struggled to hone their edge with whatever remained, hoping to turn the tide
  of the endless Succession Wars with some new innovation their enemies might not
  have considered.</p><p><strong>Experimental Technical Readout: Succession Wars,
  Volume 1</strong> samples some of the desperate technological experiments that the
  war-ravaged powers of the Inner Sphere tinkered with during the post-Star League
  Succession Wars period. Each design featured in this book demonstrates the combination
  of regressing post-Star League technology levels on the BattleMechs, combat vehicles,
  and aerospace units that followed. Statistics and Record Sheets are included for
  14 BattleMechs, vehicles, aerospace units presented in this book, ready for play
  in advanced <i>BattleTech</i> games.</p><p><br><br><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/experimental-technical-readout-succession-wars-pdf">Buy
