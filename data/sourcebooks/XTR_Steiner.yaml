description: '<p><strong>Steiner Know-How</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The devastating
  assaults of the Jihad have ravaged many of the factories that made House Steiner''s
  Lyran Alliance the epitome of industrial and commercial might. For the first time
  in centuries, Hesperus II was seized by a foreign power, and even the capitol world
  of Tharkad lived under the yoke of the Word of Blake. But now that the Word is in
  retreat, and the industrial giants of the Alliance are racing to rebuild, new weapons
  and techniques are coming into play. Employing technologies for the next generation,
  the engineers of House Steiner are determined to prepare their realm for wars yet
  to come.</p><p><strong>Experimental Technical Readout: Steiner</strong> samples
  the custom and prototype designs that have begun to turn up in testing labs and
  top-secret proving grounds of the war-torn Lyran Alliance. Each design featured
  in this book incorporates some of the latest technologies developed by the realms
  of the Inner Sphere as the war against the Word of Blake winds toward its final
  conclusion. These technologies--first described in Tactical Operations --have yet
  to achieve widespread production, but each has been prototyped and rushed to the
  field for their desperate consumers. Statistics and Record Sheets are included for
  13 new experimental BattleMechs, vehicles, aerospace units, and battle armor designs
  presented in this book, ready for play in advanced <i>BattleTech</i> games.</p><p><br><a
