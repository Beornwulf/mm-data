description: 'Nearly every faith in human history has had its militant, stalwart protectors
  of the light ready to cast down those who would question the true path. The vision
  of Blessed Blake is no different. The creation of the Republic and its disbanding
  of the Com Guard cast a deep shadow, but true faith endures. Now, amid a Dark Age,
  the light of Blake is needed more than ever and the Blessed Order stands ready to
  share it with the Inner Sphere. For the warriors of Unending Faith, the end of the
  Com Guard was only the beginning.<p><p>_x000D_
