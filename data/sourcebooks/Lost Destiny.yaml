  _x000D_

  The Clans. Warriors bred for battle and piloting fantastic war machines, Clansmen
  live for victory and pray for death before defeat.<p>_x000D_

  _x000D_

  Invaders from beyond the Periphery, the Clans have beaten the forces of the Inner
  Sphere repeatedly. Now the Clans are driving toward their ultimate objective—Terra,
  cradle of humankind and hub of the ComStar communications network.<p>_x000D_

  _x000D_

  Nothing the Inner Sphere has can stop them. The heir to the throne of the Draconis
  Combine is missing. Whole regiments of BattleMechs lie smashed like abandoned toys.
  Rasalhague is overrun. The Clans are sweeping toward the center of the known universe
  in a relentless tide.<p>_x000D_

  _x000D_

  Humanity''s only hope lies in the Inner Sphere''s most powerful traitor.<p>_x000D_

  _x000D_

  ComStar betrayed the Inner Sphere by aiding the Clans in their conquests. Now the
  mystic sect that controls all interstellar communication must face the Clan hordes
  alone. And only a mysterious, elderly warrior—and the untested warriors of ComStar—are
  the Inner Sphere''s last defense against total defeat._x000D_
