  <p>Shrapnel: The Official BattleTech Magazine delivers tales of tragedy and triumph
  amid the struggles of BattleMechs on the battlefields of the 31st century and beyond!
  A spurned Solaris gladiator enacts a unique brand of payback. A Federated Suns mission
  to take down the infamous “Lady Death” Trevaline runs afoul of pirate ingenuity.
  A ex-mercenary on Outreach must risk everything during the Fourth Succession War
  to protect those who cannot protect themselves. In this issue, you’ll venture into
  the jungles and avoid native predators while racing to recover lost Star League-era
  data; discover the truth lurking behind a seemingly unbeatable Word of Blake ’Mech;
  and fight to preserve a MechWarrior’s right to crack open a cold, frosty beverage
  after the battle is done. Then return to the shadows and danger of the Game World
  with the penultimate part of our Solaris VII serial._x000D_

  <p>Keep cool under fire with technical readouts, a playable campaign, glimpses at
  the Malthus Confederation and Canopian pleasure circuses, a guide for new citizens
  of the Federated Suns, a report on dangerous alien plant life, and much more—all
  from BattleTech veterans and a few new faces:_x000D_
