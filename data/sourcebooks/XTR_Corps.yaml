description: '<p><strong>Corporate Review</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mercenaries
  aren''t the only ones who see the profits in war. As the Word of Blake crumbles
  before the might of rallying Houses, the latest surge in military demand could ebb
  along with it. But there is always another conflict around the corner, and the interstellar
  arms conglomerates--from Defiance Industries and StarCorps to Imstar Aerospace and
  Wakazashi Enterprises--are all banking on the next surge in inevitable military
  spending with a plethora of new prototype war machines for the post-Jihad end-user...</p><p><strong>Experimental
  Technical Readout: Corporations</strong> samples the custom and prototype designs
  that are still going through their shakedown trials in the corporate research sites
  throughout the BattleTech universe. Each design featured in this book incorporates
  some of the latest technologies developed by the realms of the Inner Sphere as the
  war against the Word of Blake thunders on. These technologies--first described in
  <i>Tactical Operations</i>--have yet to face their first actions in real combat,
  but each has been tailored for an eventual debut on battlefields yet to come. Statistics
  and Record Sheets are included for 13 new experimental BattleMechs, vehicles and
  aerospace units presented in this book, ready for play in advanced <i>BattleTech</i>
  games.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-experimental-technical-readout-corporations-pdf">Buy
