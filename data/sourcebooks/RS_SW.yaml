description: '<p><strong>KING OF THE BATTLEFIELD</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On February
  5, 2439, the Mackie obliterated all opposition during its first combat trial, ushering
  in a new era of warfare. The BattleMech—King of the Battlefield—was born. BattleMechs
  reached their pinnacle during the golden age of the Star League. The fall of the
  Star League and the Succession Wars that raged for centuries afterward took their
  toll and by the Fourth Succession War, the technology employed on the battlefields
  was a mere shadow of what it once was. However, the discovery of the Helm Memory
  Core unlocked the technological potential to develop new BattleMechs and experimental
  technologies for the first time in centuries.</p><p><strong>BattleTech Record Sheets:
  Succession Wars</strong> offers players the record sheets for all the ''Mechs detailed
  in <i>BattleTech Technical Readout: Succession Wars</i>, 290 in total.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>Note:
