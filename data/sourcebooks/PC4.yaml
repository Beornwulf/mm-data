  The BattleMech. Mechanical king of the battlefield. Prized. Feared. Coveted.<p>_x000D_

  _x000D_

  Fearing being left behind in the arms race among the other Great Houses, the Draconis
  Combine will do anything—anything—to possess this fearsome technology.<p>_x000D_

  Even grind its most loyal subject into useless husks in a decades-long attempt to
