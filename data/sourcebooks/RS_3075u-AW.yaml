description: '<p>In 3067 the Second Star League disbanded. The Word of Blake, on the
  verge of joining in fulfillment of prophecies, acted in rage and launched the Jihad,
  pitting every faction against each other and even themselves. Against such an anvil,
  new cutting edge machines of war emerged. The discovery of an ancient Hegemony Memory
  Core graphically showcases the desperation of the conflict, as primitive ''Mechs
  not seen on a battlefield in half a millennia once again appear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BattleTech
  Record Sheets: 3075 Unabridged -- Age of War</strong> offers players the record
  sheets for all the ''Mechs detailed in the corresponding section of <i>BattleTech
  Technical Readout: 3075</i>, over 200 in total, many variants making their debut
  here.</p><p>NOTE: This PDF does not contain record sheets for JumpShips and WarShips;
  pre-filled record sheets for these unit types from Technical Readout: 3075 will
  be added in the future. The designs from the Cutting Edge section of <i>Technical
  Readout: 3075</i> can be found in <i>BattleTech Record Sheets: 3075 Unabridged --
  The Cutting Edge</i>.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-record-sheet-total-warfare-style-3075-age-of-war">Buy
