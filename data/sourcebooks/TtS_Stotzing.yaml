description: '<p>The Star League’s terraforming technology brought life to worlds
  struggling to survive, and wrought miracles on landscapes thought uninhabitable.
  But Stotzing is proof that even miracles can be undone by human hands, and not all
  those who seek to repair them are angels…_x000D_

  <p>Touring the Stars is a whistle-stop tour of the universe! Every system and planet
  where mankind treads in the BattleTech universe has a story, for those with the
  drive to explore it. Take a tour of the stars humanity now calls home, experience
  awesome new worlds, immerse yourself in the local civilization, and prepare to do
  battle in exotic locales._x000D_
