description: '<p><strong>Birth of a new society...</strong> The Clans, brainchild
  of Nicholas Kerensky, emerged from the ashes of the decimated Star League Defense
  Force to create a new order in distant lands. Ritualizing combat, they established
  a new society where only the strongest warriors rule and justice is won through
  battle.</p><p>Ironically, it would be the death of the Clans'' founder that would
  catalyze this new society and spur a period of amazing technological and social
  growth known as the Golden Century. This was the age where Kerensky''s warriors
  and their descendants truly forged themselves into the powerful army that would
  one day return to the Inner Sphere in a righteous Crusade.</p><p><strong>Era Digest:
  Golden Century</strong> is a mini-sourcebook that describes the development of the
  Clans at their origin in a new series format, giving players a glimpse of early
  Clan life, the basics of Clan rituals, and a look at the rise and fall of Clan Mongoose.
  Complete with rules and stats for several Golden Century units--including the first
  OmniMechs--<i>Era Digest: Golden Century</i> also features role-playing support
  for this crucial period in BattleTech history!</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-era-digest-golden-century-pdf">Buy
