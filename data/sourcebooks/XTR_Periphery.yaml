description: '<p><strong>Peripheral Developments</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For many
  of the major realms in the Periphery, the Jihad was just as devastating as it was
  to the Great Houses and Clans of the Inner Sphere. But as the tide began to turn
  against the Word of Blake, the fanatics withdrew from most of these fringe worlds
  first, leaving behind technology and techniques that further fanned the flames of
  technological recovery. Scrambling to rebuild, the industries of the Periphery have
  almost reached technological parity with the larger Inner Sphere states, and new
  weapons and techniques are appearing even among these disparate, often-overlooked
  realms.</p><p><strong>Experimental Technical Readout: Periphery</strong> samples
  the custom and prototype designs that have begun to turn up in testing labs and
  top-secret proving grounds of the scattered realms of the local Periphery. Each
  design featured in this book incorporates some of the latest technologies developed
  by the realms of the Inner Sphere as the war against the Word of Blake winds toward
  its final conclusion. These technologies--first described in <i>Tactical Operations</i>
  --have yet to achieve widespread production, but each has been prototyped and rushed
  to the field for their desperate consumers. Statistics and Record Sheets are included
  for 13 new experimental BattleMechs, vehicles, aerospace units, and battle armor
  designs presented in this book, ready for play in advanced <i>BattleTech</i> games.</p><p><br><br><br><a
