description: '<p><strong>Brighest Blade</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>House Davion has
  dominated the Inner Sphere politics, especially the military-industrial complex,
  for centuries. A drive for technological innovation that reaches both the military
  and civilian sectors; a society built around the freedoms of the every-day man;
  a feudal system that empowers the First Prince of House Davion like no other: the
  swords of the Federated Suns have sliced out the largest and arguably most powerful
  realm in the history of mankind. Despite of the recent ravages of a civil war, the
  people of House Davion know their place in history.</p><p><strong>Handbook: House
  Davion</strong> provides an in-depth look at the politics, the cultures and the
  ever-present military of one of the most dominant players in the Inner Sphere. Yet
  <i>Handbook: House Davion</i> includes more than just background information, providing
  a plethora of new creatures, personnel weapons, life paths and more, for both <i>BattleTech</i>
  and <i>Classic BattleTech RPG</i> campaigns set in the Federated Suns!</p><p><br><a
