  discovered a long-forgotten Star League memory core, capturing the imagination of
  the entire Inner Sphere along the way. Since then, the famed unit has continued
  to blaze a trail of glory across the reaches of known space.<p><p>_x000D_

  Now Day of Heroes, a new BattleTech campaign pack, lets you share in this legendary
  Legion''s exploits as it slugs its way through three separate campaigns. Join the
  Gray Death''s MechWarriors as they battle House Kurita''s renowned First Ghost Regiment
  during the War of 3039. Share their agonizing defeats and hard-earned victories
  as they struggle against the savage might of Clan Jade Falcon on Sudeten and Pandora.
  Stand side by side with these brave men and women as the Second Skye Rebellion traps
  half the unit on Glengarry and forces a young Alexander Carlyle to lead them as
  they struggle for their lives against an overwhelming foe.<p>_x000D_
