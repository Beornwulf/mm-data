  \ decades after the events that nearly brought the Successor States to the brink\
  \ of all-out war, the Great Houses exist in an uneasy peace.<p>_x000D_\n_x000D_\n\
  But now, from out beyond the Periphery comes a new threat. A swift-moving military\
  \ force of unknown origin.<p>_x000D_\n_x000D_\nNothing the Inner Sphere has can\
  \ stop them. Their power, speed, and ferocity are unparalleled. Some of the finest\
  \ warriors and ablest units have challenged them and been crushed. No force has\
  \ faced them and won.<p>_x000D_\n_x000D_\nThey are the Clans! A military juggernaut\
  \ whose sole reason for existence is battle. A race that selectively breeds itself\
  \ for combat.<p>_x000D_\n_x000D_\n Humanity’s only hope is an alliance of mortal\
  \ enemies. The Federated Commonwealth and the Draconis Combine, interstellar empires\
  \ at war for 300 years, must now stand side-by-side—or face certain destruction._x000D_\n\
