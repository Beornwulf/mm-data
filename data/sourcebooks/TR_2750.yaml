description: '<p>In the year 2750, humanity was in the midst of a golden age. United
  under the interstellar government of the Star League, all mankind prospered and
  enjoyed an improved quality of life made possible by advances in technology, commerce,
  human rights, and the arts. Humanity had truly inherited the stars. But those same
  advances also carried a curse, for the engines of war from the Star League era possessed
  power unequalled in the Successor States today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>BattleTech Technical
  Readout: 2750 provides illustrations, statistics, and other vital information about
  the BattleMechs, AeroSpace Fighters, Tanks and Hovercraft, Personal Equipment, and
