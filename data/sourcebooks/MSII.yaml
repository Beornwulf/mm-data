  Kell Hounds. Northwind Highlanders. Blue Star Irregulars. Literally a thousand and
  one mercenary units populate the Inner Sphere, yet these are the household names
  that captivate the common man. But for every top, there is a bottom. Gray''s Ghosts.
  Kraken Unleashed. Vinson''s Vigilantes. Some call them ''pirates,'' others ''down-on-their-luck,''
  and others ''salvation'' when the job''s small enough and the pay just right. But
  for these hard-boiled warriors, life isn''t cheap. Life hardly exists at all!<p>_x000D_
