description: <p>A High Price to Pay!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For years, the bitter rivalry
  between the warriors of the Wolf Clan and the Jade Falcons simmered. Then in June
  of 3057, growing political tensions among the fearsome invaders erupted in a bloody
  war of attrition. From the mountains of Colmar to the icy wasteland of Morges, the
  armies of these ancient enemies clashed in a dramatic duel to the death.</p><p>The
  Falcon and the Wolf is a BattleTech scenario pack that describes the epic Trial
  of Refusal between the Wolf and Jade Falcon Clans described in the BattleTech novel
  Bred for War. Filled with historical notes and personal accounts of the trial, game
  scenarios and special Clan rules, The Falcon and the Wolf provides everything the
  BattleTech player needs to recreate the battles of this major intraClan conflict.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br><a
