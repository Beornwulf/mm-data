description: '<p><strong>AVALON DARKENED</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2796 New Avalon
  almost fell to the ravening Draconis Combine. Yet House Davion rebounded, becoming
  one of the most powerful of Houses. Since then Avalon City and the capital of the
  Federated Suns have stood as a beacon of hope for all mankind.</p><p>Then came the
  Jihad.</p><p><strong>Jihad Turning Points: New Avalon</strong> fleshes out the details
  of the conflict surrounding this pivotal world published in various Jihad Plot Sourcebooks.
  Additionally, players can join one of the myriad of forces fighting for control--and
  survival--of the Federated Sun''s capital world.</p><p>This campaign series uses
  the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual battles,
  following a campaign arc, inserting it into their own campaigns and even create
  their own scenarios with optional rules to give their games a ''New Avalon flavor.''
  The ebook includes a detailed map of the world of New Avalon, a run down of the
  forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks that players can use to run
  simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage up to a world-wide invasion. Only the players''
  imaginations are the limits.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/02-battletech-jihad-turning-points-new-avalon-pdf">Buy
