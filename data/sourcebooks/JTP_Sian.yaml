description: '<p><strong>SIAN ABLAZE!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The most important
  world in the Capellan Confederation, the verdant and serene capital has been the
  seat of the Chancellor''s power for centuries.</p><p>Then came the Jihad. And more
  damaging, the betrayal of one of Liao''s own blood.</p><p><strong>Jihad Turning
  Points: Sian</strong> fleshes out the details of the conflicts that swirl across
  this pivotal world published in various Jihad Plot Sourcebooks. Additionally, players
  can join one of the myriad of forces fighting for control--and survival--of the
  center of House Liao''s heart and soul.</p><p>This campaign series uses the Chaos
  Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual battles, following
  a campaign arc, inserting it into their own campaigns and even create their own
  scenarios with optional rules to give their games a ''Sian flavor.'' The ebook includes
  a detailed map of the world of Sian, a run down of the forces involved in the conflict,
  and several tracks that players can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles, or
  stage up to a world-wide invasion. Only the players'' imaginations are the limits.</p><p><br><a
