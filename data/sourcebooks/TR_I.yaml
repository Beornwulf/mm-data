description: '<p><strong>“The lions are those who managed to take the grid down, while
  the jackals are feeding on the resulting confusion.”</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fall
  of 3134. After decades of peace and prosperity, interstellar communications broke
  down two years ago and conflict is sweeping through the Republic of the Sphere.
  As ancient hatreds and rivalries rear their ugly heads, people who have only known
  war through history books are suddenly thrust into the dark maelstrom of combat.
  Splinter factions have arisen, aligning themselves with fealties long thought forgotten,
  and stalking each other on Republic worlds like jackals. Often lacking military-grade
  equipment, these groups and defending militias deploy SecurityMechs, Support Vehicles,
  or even modified civilian machinery in their desperate struggle to prevail.</p><p><strong>Technical
  Readout: Irregulars</strong> unveils the weapons deployed during the chaos after
  Gray Monday when paramilitaries warred in the Republic’s outer Prefectures. <i>Technical
  Readout: Irregulars</i> debuts the production and custom machines used by the the
  splinter faction in 3132 and the following years. Statistics and Record Sheets are
  included for 25 new IndustrialMech MODs, Security- and MilitiaMechs, support vehicles,
  and their variants ready for play.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-technical-readout-irregulars">Buy
