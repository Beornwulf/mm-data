  The Battle of Tukayyid brings players back to this gargantuan conflict, allowing
  them to relive one of BattleTech’s most pivotal moments. It builds off of the Chaos
  Campaign: Succession Wars framework to unleash a massive experience players will
  enjoy across dozens of games. Each of the seven campaigns within includes the following:
  a short fiction entry and write-up of the battle, including a map of the regions;
  the specific Combatants involved, along with insignia; and details to allow players
  to play out each campaign on their tabletop. Finally, a technical readout section
  showcases ’Mech variants that first appeared during this conflict.<br>_x000D_

  This Chaos Campaign puts you as the hero—Aidan Pryde, Anastatius Focht, and others—of
  the battle. Do you have what it takes to lead the Smoke Jaguars to victory, or will
  you repeat the failure of the Diamond Sharks? Or can you find a way to defeat the
  indomitable Clan Wolf? You will decide._x000D_
