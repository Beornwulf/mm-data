description: '<p><strong>Wars Past. Wars Present.</strong> In the 3050s, the discoveries
  of long-buried Star League records led to a plethora of new cutting-edge BattleMech
  and vehicle designs by the end of that decade, resurrected from the blueprints of
  design firms centuries old and thought lost to antiquity. Ten years later, these
  designs have moved from novelty to workhorse, as the Inner Sphere once more finds
  itself at war!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fully updated to circa 3070, <strong>BattleTech
  Technical Readout: 3058 Upgrade</strong> launches these designs into the Jihad time
  frame, including notable MechWarriors/crews, as well as new variants. Additionally,
  a battle armor section has been included, providing full BattleTech stats, and updating
  the histories for these twenty venerable designs.</p><p>NOTE: This is a Catalyst-branded
  reprint, with a new cover and including all appropriate errata. No other changes
  have been made.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-technical-readout-3058-upgrade-pdf-1">Buy
