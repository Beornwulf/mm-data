description: '<p><strong>Ancient Wonders</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before there
  was even a Star League, the technologies taken for granted in the thirty-first century
  went through their awkward paces in a universe newly opened to humankind. In an
  age when the BattleMech was nearly unknown, when the DropShip was a new concept,
  and when tanks and fighters dominated the battle zones, the technology of the day
  was primitive by modern standards...and each new design with an experiment unto
  itself.</p><p><strong>Experimental Tech Readout: Primitives, Volume 1</strong> samples
  the early technology designs that dominated the universe of BattleTech during the
  pre-Star League Age of War period. Each design featured in this book demonstrates
  the primitive technology level of the first generation of BattleMechs, the last
  generation of Combat Vehicles (before the ''Mech supplanted them), and the low-tech
  aerospace units that flew above them. Although many were ultimately upgraded to
  "modern standards" and shown in <i>Technical Readout: 3075</i>, the units featured
  here reflect these designs as they were when first introduced to the universe they
  fought for. Statistics and Record Sheets are included for 13 Primitive BattleMechs,
  vehicles, aerospace units presented in this book, ready for play in advanced <i>BattleTech</i>
  games.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-experimental-technical-readout-primitives-vol-1-pdf">Buy
