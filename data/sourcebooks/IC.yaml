  _x000D_

  <p>In 2825, ilKhan Nicholas Kerensky, the founder of the Clans, gave his exiled,
  warrior-led people a dream: the first Clan to return to the Inner Sphere and claim
  Terra, the cradle of humanity, in honorable combat would claim the title of ilClan—ruler
  of all the Clans. The ilClan would reestablish the venerable Star League from the
  ashes of the old, and its Khan would become ilKhan, supreme ruler of all the Clans.
  Now, 326 years later, the Children of Kerensky have fought their way to Terra with
  the intent of fulfilling this dream. But will this dream become destiny or nightmare?_x000D_

  _x000D_

  <p>Delve into what it means to be the ilClan, and experience the tumultuous Battle
  of Terra, which will shake the very foundations of the Inner Sphere. Then catch
  a glimpse of how the Great Houses and other major powers will face the outcome of
  this far-reaching conflict. Tactical maps, <i>Chaos Campaign</i> tracks, and new
  ’Mechs that debuted during the Battle of Terra all let you jump right into the cockpit
  and fight in the culmination of over three centuries of Clan history. Do you have
  what it takes to conquer the birthplace of humankind, or the courage to defend Terra
  from its enemies?_x000D_
