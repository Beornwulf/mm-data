description: '<p><strong>Gathering Forces...</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2765,
  the Star League Defense Force was the greatest military ever assembled, unparalleled
  in numbers and technological prowess--but it was not alone. The House Lords and
  the rules of the Territorial States in the Periphery each amassed armies of their
  own. While none of these powers alone could challenge the sheer size and might of
  the SLDF, each stood ready to defend their own interests against the avarice of
  their neighbors.</p><p><strong>2765 Field Report: FWLM</strong> describes the state
  of House Marik''s Free Worlds League just before the events described in <i>Historical:
  Liberation of Terra Vol. 1</i>, including the overall military and logistical condition
  of one of the Great Houses that would eventually survive the collapse of the Star
  League and face a new age of endless war.</p><p><br><a href="https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/battletech-field-report-2765-fwlm-pdf">Buy
