description: '<p><strong>Capellan Determination</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Assaulted
  by the Federated Suns, then betrayed by the Word of Blake, and shunned by virtually
  all others, House Liao''s Capellan Confederation stood against the Jihad alone.
  The Celestial Throne has been pummeled, and entire worlds lie in ruins. But the
  spirit of the people has never been stronger, and all across the defiant realm,
  research and development teams continue to hone the state''s technological edge.
  In factories and test sites deep within their borders, powerful new secret weapons
  are being forged to protect the Confederation against all of her enemies.</p><p><strong>Experimental
  Technical Readout: Liao</strong> samples the custom and prototype designs that have
  begun to turn up in testing labs and top-secret proving grounds of the Capellan
  Confederation. Each design featured in this book incorporates some of the latest
  technologies developed by the realms of the Inner Sphere as the war against the
  Word of Blake continues. These technologies--first described in <i>Tactical Operations</i>--have
  yet to achieve widespread production, but each has been prototyped and rushed to
  the field for their desperate consumers. Statistics and Record Sheets are included
  for 13 new experimental BattleMechs, vehicles, aerospace units, and battle armor
  designs presented in this book, ready for play in advanced <i>BattleTech</i> games.</p><p><br><a
